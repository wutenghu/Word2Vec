the new york area is home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the new york dialect alternatively known as brooklynese or new yorkese it has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within american english the classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working class people of european descent the influx of non european immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general new yorkers as in the past the traditional new york area accent is characterized as non rhotic so that the sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant hence the pronunciation of the city name as new yawk there is no in words like park p k or p k with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low back chain shift butter b or here hi in another feature called the low back chain shift the vowel sound of words like talk law cross chocolate and coffee and the often homophonous r in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in general american in the most old fashioned and extreme versions of the new york dialect the vowel sounds of words like girl and of words like oil became a diphthong this would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds so that girl is pronounced goil and oil is pronounced erl this leads to the caricature of new yorkers saying things like joizey jersey toidy toid street 33rd st and terlet toilet the character archie bunker from the 1970s sitcom all in the family played by carroll o'connor was an example of having used this pattern of speech which continues to fade in its overall presence sports new york city is home to the

boroughs of manhattan and staten island are primarily coterminous with islands of the same names while queens and brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger long island and the bronx is located at the southern tip of new york state 's mainland this situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels nearly all of the city 's major bridges and tunnels are notable and several have broken or set records the george washington bridge is the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge connecting manhattan to bergen county new jersey the verrazano narrows bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the americas and one of the world 's longest the brooklyn bridge is an icon of the city itself the towers of the brooklyn bridge

jersey by several tunnels as well the lincoln tunnel which carries 120000 vehicles a day under the hudson river between new jersey and midtown manhattan is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world the tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through new york harbor and up the hudson river to manhattan 's piers the holland tunnel connecting lower manhattan to jersey city new jersey was the world 's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927 the queens midtown tunnel built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting manhattan with queens and brooklyn was the largest non federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940 president franklin d roosevelt was the first person to drive

university of chicago and the university of illinois at chicago are classified as highest research doctoral universities chicago also has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues the city has many nicknames the best known being the windy city history beginnings the name chicago is derived from a french rendering of the native american word shikaakwa known to botanists as allium tricoccum from the miami illinois language the first known reference to the site of the current city of chicago as checagou was by robert de lasalle around 1679 in a memoir henri joutel in his journal of 1688 noted that the wild garlic called chicagoua grew abundantly in the area according to his diary of late september 1687 when we arrived at the said place called chicagou which according to what we were able to learn of it has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region in the mid 18th century the area was inhabited by a native american tribe known as the potawatomi who had taken the place of the miami and sauk and fox peoples the first known non indigenous permanent settler in chicago was jean baptiste point du sable du sable was of african and french descent and arrived in the 1780s he is commonly known as the founder of chicago in 1795 following the northwest indian war an area that was to be part of chicago was turned over to the united states for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the treaty of greenville in 1803 the united states army built fort dearborn which was destroyed in 1812 in the battle of fort dearborn and later rebuilt the ottawa ojibwe and potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the united states in the 1816 treaty of st louis the potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the treaty of chicago in 1833 founding and 19th century on august 12 1833 the town of chicago was organized with a population of about 200 within seven years it grew to more than 4000 people on june 15 1835 the first public land sales began with edmund dick taylor as u s receiver of public moneys the city of chicago was incorporated on saturday march 4 1837 and for several decades was the world 's fastest growing city as the site of the chicago portage the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western united states chicago 's first railway galena and chicago union railroad and the illinois and michigan canal opened in 1848 the canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the great lakes to connect to the mississippi river a flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant influencing the american economy the chicago board of trade established 1848 listed the first ever standardized 'exchange traded' forward contracts which were called futures contracts in the 1850s chicago gained national political prominence as the home of senator stephen douglas the champion of the kansas nebraska act and the popular sovereignty approach to the issue of the spread of slavery these issues also helped propel another illinoisan abraham lincoln to the national stage lincoln was nominated in chicago for us president at the 1860 republican national convention he defeated douglas in the general election and this set the stage for the american civil war to accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation the city improved its infrastructure in february 1856 chicago 's common council approved chesbrough 's plan to build the united states' first comprehensive sewerage system the project raised much of central chicago to a new grade while elevating chicago and at first improving the city 's health the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the chicago river then into lake michigan polluting the city 's primary freshwater source the city responded by tunneling two miles 3 km out into lake michigan to newly built water cribs in 1900 the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat it reversed the flow of the chicago river so the water flowed away from lake michigan rather than into it this project began with the construction and improvement of the illinois and michigan canal and was completed with the chicago sanitary and ship canal that connects to the illinois river which flows into the mississippi river in 1871 the great chicago fire destroyed an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide a large section of the city at the time much of the city including railroads and stockyards survived intact and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone these set a precedent for worldwide construction during its rebuilding period chicago constructed the world 's first skyscraper in 1885 using steel skeleton construction the city grew significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920 with the largest annexation happening in 1889 with five townships joining the city including the hyde park township which now comprises most of the south side of chicago and the far southeast of chicago and the jefferson township which now makes up most of chicago 's northwest side the desire to join the city was driven by municipal services the city could provide its residents chicago 's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from europe and migrants from the eastern united states of the total population in 1900 more than 77 were either foreign born or born in the united states of foreign parentage germans irish poles swedes and czechs made up nearly two thirds of the foreign born population by 1900 whites were 98 1 of the city 's population labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool including the haymarket affair on may 4 1886 concern for social problems among chicago 's immigrant poor led jane addams and ellen gates starr to found hull house in 1889 programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work during the 1870s and 1880s chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health city and later state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera smallpox and yellow fever were both passed and enforced these laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states the city established many large well landscaped municipal parks which also included public sanitation facilities the chief advocate for improving public health in chicago was dr john h rauch m d rauch established a plan for chicago 's park system in 1866 he created lincoln park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves and in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new chicago board of health ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first illinois state board of health which carried out most of its activities in chicago in the 19th century chicago became the nation 's railroad center and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals in 1883 chicago 's railway managers needed a general time convention so they developed the standardized system of north american time zones this system for telling time spread throughout the continent in 1893 chicago hosted the world 's columbian exposition on former marshland at the present location of jackson park the exposition drew 27 5 million visitors and is considered the most influential world 's fair in history the university of chicago formerly at another location moved to the same south side location in 1892 the term midway for a fair or carnival referred originally to the midway plaisance a strip of park land that still runs through the university of chicago campus and connects the washington and jackson parks 20th and 21st centuries 1900 to 1939 during world war i and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry the availability of jobs attracted african americans from the southern united states between 1910 and 1930 the african american population of chicago increased dramatically from 44103 to 233903 this great migration had an immense cultural impact called the chicago black renaissance part of the new negro movement in art literature and music continuing racial tensions and violence such as the chicago race riot of 1919 also occurred the ratification of the 18th amendment to the constitution in 1919 made the production and sale including exportation of alcoholic beverages illegal in the united states this ushered in the beginning of what is known as the gangster era a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when prohibition was repealed the 1920s saw gangsters including al capone dion o'banion bugs moran and tony accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of chicago during the prohibition era chicago was the location of the infamous st valentine 's day massacre in

and was sworn in as mayor on may 16 2011 geography cityscape topography chicago is located in northeastern illinois on the southwestern shores of lake michigan it is the principal city in the chicago metropolitan area situated in the midwestern united states and the great lakes region chicago rests on a continental divide at the site of the chicago portage connecting the mississippi river and the great lakes watersheds the city lies beside huge freshwater lake michigan and two rivers the chicago river in downtown and the calumet river in the industrial far south side flow entirely or partially through chicago chicago 's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to lake michigan while the chicago river historically handled much of the region 's waterborne cargo today 's huge lake freighters use the city 's lake calumet harbor on the south side the lake also provides another positive effect moderating chicago 's climate making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer when chicago was founded in 1833 most of the early building was around the mouth of the chicago river as can be seen on a map of the city 's original 58 blocks the overall grade of the city 's central built up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise the average land elevation is 579 ft 176 5 m above sea level the lowest points are along the lake shore at 578 ft 176 2 m while the highest point at 672 ft 205 m is the morainal ridge of blue island in the city 's far south side the chicago loop is the central business district but chicago is also a city of neighborhoods lake shore drive runs adjacent to a large portion of chicago 's lakefront some of the parks along the waterfront include lincoln park grant park burnham park and jackson park there are twenty four public beaches across 26 miles 42 km of the waterfront landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for navy pier northerly island the museum campus and large portions of the mccormick place convention center most of the city 's high rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront an informal name for the entire chicago metropolitan area is chicagoland there is no precise definition for the term chicagoland but it generally means the entire conurbation the chicago tribune which coined the term includes the city of chicago the rest of cook county eight nearby illinois counties lake mchenry dupage kane kendall grundy will and kankakee and three counties in indiana lake porter and laporte the illinois department of tourism defines chicagoland as cook county without the city of chicago and only lake dupage kane and will counties the

and the north the south and west sides the three sides of the city are represented on the flag of chicago by three horizontal white stripes the north side is the most densely populated residential section of the city and many high rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront the south side is the largest section of the city encompassing roughly 60 of the city 's land area the south side contains the university of chicago and most of the facilities of the port of chicago in the late 1920s sociologists at the university of chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods streetscape chicago 's streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the city 's original townsite plat which was bounded by lake michigan on the east north avenue on the north wood street on the west and 22nd street on the south streets following the public land survey system section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections as new additions to the city were platted city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction about one street per 201 meters by two in the other direction the grid 's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property a scattering of diagonal streets many of them originally native american trails also cross the city elston milwaukee ogden lincoln etc many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the plan of chicago but only the extension of ogden avenue was ever constructed in 2016 chicago was ranked the sixth most walkable large city in the united states many of the city 's residential streets have a wide patch of grass and or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself this helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic chicago 's western avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world other famous streets include michigan avenue state street clark street and belmont avenue the city beautiful movement inspired chicago 's boulevards and parkways architecture the destruction caused by the great chicago fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation in 1885 the first steel framed high rise building the home insurance building rose in the

domestic slave trade new orleans was the center of this trade in the deep south but slave dealers were in houston thousands of enslaved african americans lived near the city before the civil war many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs houston was granted incorporation on june 5 1837 with james s holman becoming its first mayor in the same year houston became the county seat of harrisburg county now harris county and the temporary capital of the republic of texas in 1840 the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and waterborne business at the newly created port on buffalo bayou by 1860 houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont during the american civil war houston served as a headquarters for general john bankhead magruder who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston after the civil war houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston by 1890 houston was the railroad center of texas in 1900 after galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane efforts to make houston into a viable deep water port were accelerated the following year oil discovered at the spindletop oil field near beaumont prompted the development of the texas petroleum industry in 1902 president theodore roosevelt approved a 1 million improvement project for the houston ship channel by 1910 the city 's population had reached 78800 almost doubling from a decade before african americans formed a large part of the city 's population numbering 23929 people or nearly one third of the residents president woodrow wilson opened the deep water port of houston in

white and 22 4 black when world war ii started tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended however the war did provide economic benefits for the city petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war ellington field initially built during world war i was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators the brown shipbuilding company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the u s navy during world war ii due to the boom in defense jobs thousands of new workers migrated to the city both blacks and whites competing for the higher paying jobs president roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors and blacks gained some opportunities especially in shipbuilding although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years in 1945 the m d anderson foundation formed the texas medical center after the war houston 's economy reverted to being primarily port driven in 1948 the city annexed several unincorporated areas more than doubling its size houston proper began to spread across the region in 1950 the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to houston where wages were lower than the north this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the city 's economy toward the energy sector the increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during world war ii spurred houston 's growth as did the establishment in 1961 of nasa 's manned spacecraft center renamed the lyndon b johnson space center in 1973 this was the stimulus for the development of the city 's aerospace industry the astrodome nicknamed the eighth wonder of the world opened in 1965 as the world 's first indoor domed sports stadium during the late 1970s houston had a population boom as people from the rust belt states moved to texas in large numbers the new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry created as a result of the arab oil embargo with the increase in professional jobs houston has become a destination for many college educated persons including african americans in a reverse great migration from northern areas one wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid 1980s as oil prices fell precipitously the space industry also suffered in 1986 after the space shuttle challenger disintegrated shortly after launch a cutback in some activities existed for a period in the late 1980s the city 's economy suffered from the nationwide recession after the early 1990s recession houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care biotechnology and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy in 1997 houstonians elected lee p brown as the city 's first african american mayor in june 2001 tropical storm allison dumped up to 40 inches 1000 mm of rain on parts of houston causing the worst flooding in the city 's history the storm cost billions of dollars in damage and killed 20 people in texas by december of that same year houston based energy company enron collapsed into the third largest ever u s bankruptcy during an investigation surrounding fabricated partnerships that were allegedly used to hide debt and inflate profits in august 2005 houston became a shelter to more than 150000 people from new orleans who evacuated from hurricane katrina one month later about 2 5 million houston area residents evacuated when hurricane rita approached the gulf coast leaving little damage to the houston area this was the largest urban evacuation in the history of the united states in september 2008 houston was hit by hurricane ike as many as 40 refused to leave galveston island because they feared the traffic problems that happened after hurricane rita during the floods in 2015 and 2016 parts of the city were covered in several inches of water geography houston is located 165 miles 266 km east of austin 112 miles 180 km west of the louisiana border and 250 miles 400 km south of dallas according to the united states census bureau the city has a total area of 656 3 square miles 1700 km2 this comprises 634 0 square miles 1642 km2 of land and 22 3 square miles 58 km2 covered by water the piney woods are north of houston most of houston is located on the gulf coastal plain and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest much of the city was built on forested land marshes swamp or prairie which resembles the deep south and are all still visible in surrounding areas the flatness of the local terrain when combined with urban sprawl has made flooding a recurring problem for the city downtown stands about 50 feet 15 m above sea level and the highest point in far northwest houston is about 125 feet 38 m in elevation the city once relied on groundwater for its needs but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground level water sources such as lake houston lake conroe and lake livingston the city owns surface water rights for 1 20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater houston has four major bayous passing through the city buffalo bayou runs through downtown and the houston ship channel and has three tributaries white oak bayou which runs through the houston heights community northwest of downtown and then towards downtown brays bayou which runs along the texas medical center and sims bayou which runs through the south of houston and downtown houston the ship channel continues past galveston and then into the gulf of mexico geology underpinning houston 's land surface are unconsolidated clays clay shales and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep the region 's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the rocky mountains these sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter that over time transformed into oil and natural gas beneath the layers of sediment is a water deposited layer of halite a rock salt the porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward as it pushed upward the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands the thick rich sometimes black surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow the houston area has over 150 active faults estimated to be 300 active faults with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles 500 km including the long point eureka heights fault system which runs through the center of the city no significant historically recorded earthquakes have occurred in houston but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past nor occurring in the future land in some areas southeast of houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years it may be associated with slip along the faults however the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves these faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep which further reduces the risk of an earthquake climate houston 's climate is classified as humid subtropical cfa in the k ppen climate classification system typical of the lower south while not located in tornado alley like much of the rest of texas spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year which bring heat and moisture from the nearby gulf of mexico during the summer temperatures commonly reach over 90 f 32 c with an average of 106 5 days per year including a majority from june to september with a high of 90 f 32 c or above and 4 6 days at or over 100 f 38 c however humidity usually yields a higher heat index summer mornings average over 90 relative humidity although sea breezes are present they do n't offer substantial relief except in the southeastern areas of the city closer to the gulf to cope with the strong humidity and heat people use air conditioning in nearly every vehicle and building in 1980 houston was described as the most air conditioned place on earth officially the hottest temperature ever recorded in houston is 109 f 43 c which was reached both on september 4 2000 and august 28 2011 houston has mild winters in contrast to most areas of the united states in january the normal mean temperature at intercontinental airport is 53 1 f 11 7 c while that station has an average of 13 days with a low at or below freezing snowfall is rare recent snow events in houston include a storm on december 24 2004 when 1 0 in 2 5 cm of snow accumulated in parts of the metro area falls of at least 1 0 in 25 mm on both december 10 2008 and december 4 2009 marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred in two consecutive years in the city 's recorded history the coldest temperature officially recorded in houston was 5 f 15 c on january 18 1930 houston has historically received an ample amount of rainfall averaging about 49 8 in 1260 mm annually per 1981 2010 normals localized flooding often occurs owing to the extremely flat topography and widespread typical clay silt prairie soils which do not drain quickly houston has excessive ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone polluted cities in the united states ground level ozone or smog is houston 's predominant air pollution problem with the american lung association rating the metropolitan area 's ozone level sixth on the top 10 most ozone polluted cities in 2014 the industries located along the ship channel are a major cause of the city 's air pollution in 2006 houston 's air quality was comparable to that of los angeles cityscape houston was incorporated in 1837 under the ward system of representation the ward designation is the progenitor of the 11 current day geographically oriented houston city council districts locations in houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the interstate 610 loop the inside encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that antedate world war ii more recently high density residential areas have been developed within the loop the city 's outlying areas suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles 8 0 km farther out though houston is the largest city in the united states without formal zoning regulations it has developed similarly to other sun belt cities because the city 's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role regulations include mandatory lot size for single family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers such restrictions have had mixed results though some have blamed the city 's low density urban sprawl and lack of pedestrian friendliness on these policies the city 's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing sparing houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis the city issued 42697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009 voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land use districts in 1948 1962 and 1993 consequently rather than a single central business district as the center of the city 's employment multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include uptown texas medical center midtown greenway plaza memorial city energy corridor westchase and greenspoint architecture houston has the fourth tallest skyline in north america after new york city chicago and toronto and 12th tallest in the world as of 2014 a seven mile 11 km system of tunnels and skywalks links downtown buildings containing shops and restaurants enabling

under construction in the 19th century philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of european immigrants it became a prime destination for african americans in the great migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950 based on the similar shifts underway the nation 's economy in the late 1960s philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the usa and often overseas as a result the economic base of philadelphia which had historically been manufacturing declined significantly in addition consolidation in several american industries retailing financial services and health care in particular reduced the number of companies headquartered in philadelphia the economic impact of these changes would reduce philadelphia 's tax base and the resources of local government philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes coupled with significant

lenape are a native american tribe and first nations band government they are also called delaware indians and their historical territory was along the delaware river watershed western long island and the lower hudson valley most lenape were pushed out of their delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding european colonies exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases mainly smallpox and violent conflict with europeans iroquois people occasionally fought the lenape surviving lenape moved west into the upper

continued to have their own militia religion and court and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the dutch the english conquered the new netherland colony in 1664 but the situation did not really change until 1682 when the area was included in william penn 's charter for pennsylvania in 1681 in partial repayment of a debt charles ii of england granted william penn a charter for what would become the pennsylvania colony despite the royal charter penn bought the land from the local lenape to be on good terms with the native americans and ensure peace for his colony penn made a treaty of friendship with lenape chief tammany under an elm tree at shackamaxon in what is now the city 's fishtown section penn named the city philadelphia which is greek for brotherly love from philos love or friendship and adelphos brother as a quaker penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely this tolerance far more than afforded by most other colonies led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered philadelphia 's rapid growth into america 's most important city penn planned a city on the delaware river to serve as a port and place for government hoping that philadelphia would become more like an english rural town instead of a city penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards the city 's inhabitants did not follow penn 's plans as they crowded by the delaware river the port and subdivided and resold their lots before penn left philadelphia

he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there the viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716 as he wanted to forestall any french expansion into the area from their colony of la louisiane as well as prevent illegal trading with the payaya he directed martin de alarc n the governor of coahuila and texas to establish the mission complex differences between alarc n and olivares resulted in delays and construction did not start until 1718 fray antonio de olivares built with the help of the payaya indians the misi n de san antonio de valero the alamo the presidio san antonio de bexar the bridge that connected both and the acequia madre de valero the families who clustered around the presidio and mission formed the beginnings of

southwestern lands which took place over the following century juan leal goraz jr was a prominent figure he claimed nearly 100000 sq miles 153766 acres as spanish territory and held some control for nearly three decades this area stretched across six present day states san antonio was designated as leal goraz 's capital it represented mexican expansion into the area with his robust military forces he led exploration and establishing spanish colonial bases as far as san francisco california widespread bankruptcy forced leal goraz jr 's army back into the current boundaries of mexico they

defending the old mission the battle of the alamo took place from february 23 to march 6 1836 the outnumbered texian force was ultimately defeated with all of the alamo defenders killed these men were seen as martyrs for the cause of texas freedom and remember the alamo became a rallying cry in the texian army 's eventual success at defeating santa anna 's army juan segu n who organized the company of tejano patriots who fought for texas independence fought at the battle of concepci n siege of bexar and the battle of san jacinto and served as mayor of san antonio he was forced out of that office

frederick law olmsted the landscape architect who designed central park in new york city traveled throughout the south and southwest and published accounts of his observations in his 1859 book about texas olmsted described san antonio as having a jumble of races costumes languages and buildings which gave it a quality that only new orleans could rival in what he described as odd and antiquated foreignness in 1877 following the reconstruction era developers constructed the first railroad to san antonio connecting it to major markets and port cities texas was the first state to have major cities develop by railroads rather than waterways in texas the railroads supported a markedly different pattern of development of major interior cities such as san antonio dallas and fort worth compared to the historical development of coastal port cities in the established eastern states at the beginning of the 20th century the streets of the city 's downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic at that time many of the older historic buildings were demolished in the process of this modernization since the late twentieth century san antonio has had steady

of the same year mission san diego de alcal was founded by franciscan friars under jun pero serra by 1797 the mission boasted the largest native population in alta california with over 1400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper mission san diego was the southern anchor in california of the historic mission trail el camino real both the presidio and the mission are national historic landmarks mexican period in 1821 mexico won its independence from spain and san diego became part of the mexican territory of alta california in 1822 mexico began attempting to extend its authority over the coastal territory of alta california the fort on presidio hill was gradually abandoned while the town of san diego grew up on the level land below presidio hill the mission was secularized by the mexican government in 1833 and most of the mission lands were sold to wealthy californio settlers the 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo and juan mar a osuna was elected the first alcalde municipal magistrate defeating p o pico in the vote see list of pre statehood mayors of san diego however san diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents beyond town mexican land grants expanded the number of california ranchos that modestly added to the local economy in 1846 the united states went to war against mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer alta california at first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including san diego but the californios in southern alta california struck back following the successful revolt in los angeles the american garrison at san diego was driven out without firing a shot in early october 1846 mexican partisans held san diego for three weeks until october 24 1846 when the americans recaptured it for the next several months the americans were blockaded inside the pueblo skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night the californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the americans and their californio supporters out on december 1 the americans garrison learned that the dragoons of general stephen w kearney were at warner 's ranch commodore robert f stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under captain archibald gillespie to march north to meet him their joint command of 150 men returning to san diego encountered about 93 californios under andr s pico in the ensuing battle of san pasqual fought in the san pasqual valley which is now part of the city of san diego the americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign subsequently a column led by lieutenant gray arrived from san diego rescuing kearny 's battered and blockaded command stockton and kearny went on to recover los angeles and force the capitulation of alta california with the treaty of cahuenga on january 13 1847 as a result of the mexican american war of 1846 48 the territory of alta california including san diego was ceded to the united states by mexico under the terms of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 the mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain san diego as part of mexico but the americans insisted that san diego was for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of san francisco and the mexican american border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of san diego bay so as to include the entire bay within the united states american period the state of california was admitted to the united states in 1850 that same year san diego was designated the seat of the newly established san diego county and was incorporated as a city joshua h bean the last alcalde of san diego was elected the first mayor two years later the city was bankrupt the california legislature revoked the city 's charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees where it remained until 1889 a city charter was re established in 1889 and today 's city charter was adopted in 1931 the original town of san diego was located at the foot of presidio hill in the area which is now old town san diego state historic park the location was not ideal being several miles away from navigable water in 1850 william heath davis promoted a new development by the bay shore called new san diego several miles south of the original settlement however for several decades the new development consisted only a few houses a pier and an army depot in the late 1860s alonzo horton promoted a move to the bayside area which he called new town and which became downtown san diego horton promoted the area heavily and people and businesses began to relocate to new town because of its location on san diego bay convenient to shipping new town soon eclipsed the original settlement known to this day as old town and became the economic and governmental heart of the city still san diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878 in the early part of the 20th century san diego hosted two world 's fairs the panama california exposition in 1915 and the california pacific international exposition in 1935 both expositions were held in balboa park and many of the spanish baroque style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park the buildings were intended to be temporary structures but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair most were eventually rebuilt using castings of the original fa ades to retain the architectural style the menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the san diego zoo during the 1950s there was a citywide festival called fiesta del pacifico highlighting the area 's spanish and mexican past in the 2010s there was a proposal for a large scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of balboa park but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business the southern portion of the point loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852 over the next several decades the army set up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the area fort rosecrans significant u s navy presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the navy coaling station in point loma and expanded greatly during the 1920s by 1930 the city was host to naval base san diego naval training center san diego san diego naval hospital camp matthews and camp kearny now marine corps air station miramar the city was also an early center for aviation as early as world war i san diego was proclaiming itself the air capital of the west the city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like ryan airlines later ryan aeronautical founded in 1925 and consolidated aircraft later convair founded in 1923 charles a lindbergh 's plane the spirit of st louis was built in san diego in 1927 by ryan airlines during world war ii san diego became a major hub of military and defense activity due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers the city 's population grew rapidly during and after world war ii more than doubling between 1930 147995 and 1950 333865 during the final months of the war the japanese had a plan to target multiple u s cities for biological attack starting with san diego the plan was called operation cherry blossoms at night and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague yersinia pestis to crash into civilian population centers in the city hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians the plan was scheduled to launch on september 22 1945 but was not carried out because japan surrendered five weeks earlier after world war ii the military continued to play a major role in the local economy but post cold war cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries the resulting downturn led san diego leaders to seek to diversify the city 's economy by focusing on research and science as well as tourism from the start of the 20th century through the 1970s the american tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in san diego the tuna capital of the world san diego 's first tuna cannery was founded in 1911 and by the mid 1930s the canneries employed more than 1000 people a large fishing fleet supported the canneries mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from japan and later from the portuguese azores and italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like little italy and point loma due to rising costs and foreign competition the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s downtown san diego was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s but experienced some urban renewal since the early 1980s including the opening of horton plaza the revival of the gaslamp quarter and the construction of the san diego convention center petco park opened in 2004 geography according to sdsu professor emeritus monte marshall san diego bay is the surface expression of a north south trending nested graben the rose canyon and point loma fault zones are part of the san andreas fault system about 15 miles 24 km east of the bay are the laguna mountains in the peninsular ranges which are part of the backbone of the american continents the city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating its mesas creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography traditionally san diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild thus the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low density car centered environment the san diego river runs through the middle of san diego from east to west creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments the river used to flow into san diego bay and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest spanish explorers several reservoirs and mission trails regional park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city notable peaks within the city limits include cowles mountain the highest point in the city at 1591 feet 485 m black mountain at 1558 feet 475 m and mount soledad at 824 feet 251 m the cuyamaca mountains and laguna mountains rise to the east of the city and beyond the mountains are desert areas the cleveland national forest is a half hour drive from downtown san diego numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city in its 2013 parkscore ranking the trust for public land reported that san diego had the 9th best park system among the 50 most populous u s cities parkscore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes acreage access and service and investment communities and neighborhoods the city of san diego recognizes 52 individual areas as community planning areas within a given planning area there may be several distinct neighborhoods altogether the city contains more than 100 identified neighborhoods downtown san diego is located on san diego bay balboa park encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast surrounded by older dense urban communities including hillcrest and north park to the east and southeast lie city heights the college area and southeast san diego to the north lies mission valley and interstate 8 the communities north of the valley and freeway and south of marine corps air station miramar include clairemont kearny mesa tierrasanta and navajo stretching north from miramar are the northern suburbs of mira mesa scripps ranch rancho pe asquitos and rancho bernardo the far northeast portion of the city encompasses lake hodges and the san pasqual valley which holds an agricultural preserve carmel valley and del mar heights occupy the northwest corner of the city to their south are torrey pines state reserve and the business center of the golden triangle further south are the beach and coastal communities of la jolla pacific beach mission beach and ocean beach point loma occupies the peninsula across san diego bay from downtown the communities of south san diego such as san ysidro and otay mesa are located next to the mexico united states border and are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of national city and chula vista a narrow strip of land at the bottom of san diego bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city for the most part san diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street patterns the city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when it organized its 2008 general plan around the concept of a city of villages cityscape san diego was originally centered on the old town district but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront in the belief that this new location would increase trade as the new town present day downtown waterfront location quickly developed it eclipsed old town as the center of san diego the development of skyscrapers over 300 feet 91 m in san diego is attributed to the construction of the el cortez hotel in 1927 the tallest building in the city from 1927 to 1963 as time went on multiple buildings claimed the title of san diego 's tallest skyscraper including the union bank of california building and symphony towers currently the tallest building in san diego is one america plaza standing 500 feet 150 m tall which was completed in 1991 the downtown skyline contains no super talls as a regulation put in place by the federal aviation administration in the 1970s set a 500 feet 152 m limit on the height of buildings within a one mile 1 6 km radius of the san diego international airport an iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox climate san diego is one of the top ten best climates in the farmers' almanac and is one of the two best summer climates in america as scored by the weather channel under the k ppen geiger climate classification system the san diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi arid climate bsh in the original classification and bskn in modified k ppen classification or a mediterranean climate csa and csb san diego 's climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between december and march the city has a mild climate year round with an average of 201 days above 70 f 21 c and low rainfall 9 13 inches 230 330 mm annually the climate in san diego like most of southern california often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates in san diego this is mostly because of the city 's topography the bay and the numerous hills mountains and canyons frequently particularly during the may gray june gloom period a thick marine layer cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5 10 miles 8 0 16 1 km inland sometimes the june gloom lasts into july causing cloudy skies over most of san diego for the entire day even in the absence of june gloom inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas where the ocean serves as a moderating influence thus for example downtown san diego averages january lows of 50 f 10 c and august highs of 78 f 26 c the city of el cajon just 10 miles 16 km inland from downtown san diego averages january lows of 42 f 6 c and august highs of 88 f 31 c a sign of global warming scientists at scripps institution of oceanography say the average surface temperature of the water at scripps pier in the california current has increased by almost 3 degrees since 1950 annual rainfall along the coast averages 10 65 inches 271 mm and the median is 9 6 inches 240 mm the months of december through march supply most of the rain with february the only month averaging 2 inches 51 mm or more the months of may through september tend to be almost completely dry although there are few wet days per month during the rainy period rainfall can be heavy when it does fall rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of san diego some of the higher areas can receive 11 15 inches 280 380 mm per year variability from year to year can be dramatic in the wettest years of 1883 1884 and 1940 1941 more than 24 inches 610 mm fell whilst in the driest years as little as 3 2 inches 80 mm the wettest month on record is december 1921 with 9 21 inches 234 mm snow in the city is so rare that it has been observed only five times in the century and a half that records have been kept in 1949 and 1967 snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations like point loma and la jolla the other three occasions in 1882 1946 and 1987 involved flurries but no accumulation ecology like most of southern california the majority of san diego 's current area was originally occupied by chaparral a plant community made up mostly of drought resistant shrubs the endangered torrey pine has the bulk of its population in san diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast the steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits including tidal marsh and canyons the chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas san diego 's broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves including torrey pines state reserve los pe asquitos canyon preserve and mission trails regional park torrey pines state reserve and a coastal strip continuing to the north constitute the only location where the rare species of torrey pine p torreyana torreyana is found due to the steep topography that prevents or discourages building along with some efforts for preservation there are also a large number of canyons within the city limits that serve as nature preserves including switzer canyon tecolote canyon natural park and marian bear memorial park in the san clemente canyon as well as a number of small parks and preserves san diego county has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species that appear on the endangered list

also generally pleasant from late september to early december and on many winter days autumn often brings more storms and tornado threat but usually fewer and less severe than in spring each spring

along the colorado river in 1839 the site was officially chosen to replace houston as the new capital of the republic of texas and was incorporated under the name waterloo shortly thereafter the name was changed to austin in honor of stephen f austin the father of texas and the republic 's first secretary of state the city subsequently grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the texas state capitol and the university of texas at austin after a lull in growth from the great depression austin resumed its development into a

the desire to protect small unique and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations in the late 1800s austin was known as the city of the violet crown because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset even today many austin businesses use the term violet crown in their name austin is known as a clean air city for its stringent no smoking ordinances that apply to all public places and buildings including restaurants and bars the fbi ranked austin as the second safest major city in the u s for the year 2012 history austin travis county and williamson county have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 bc the area 's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late pleistocene ice age and are linked to the clovis culture around 9200 bc 11200 years ago based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much studied gault site midway between georgetown and fort hood when settlers arrived from europe the tonkawa tribe inhabited the area the comanches and lipan apaches were also known to travel through the area spanish colonists including the espinosa olivares aguirre expedition traveled through the area for centuries though few permanent settlements were created for some time in 1730 three missions from east texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the colorado river in what is now zilker park in austin the mission was in this area for only about seven months and then was moved to san antonio de b xar and split into three missions in the mid 18th century the san xavier missions were along the colorado river in what is now western milam county to facilitate exploration early in the 19th century spanish forts were established in what are now bastrop and san marcos following mexico 's independence new settlements were established in central texas but growth in the region was stagnant because of conflicts with the regional native americans in 1835 1836 texans fought and won independence from mexico texas thus became an independent country with its own president congress and monetary system after vice president mirabeau b lamar visited the area during a buffalo hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838 he proposed that the republic 's capital then in houston be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the colorado river near the present day congress avenue bridge in 1839 the texas congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for stephen f austin mirabeau b lamar second president of the newly formed republic of texas advised the commissioners to investigate the area named waterloo noting the area 's hills waterways and pleasant surroundings waterloo was selected and the name austin was chosen as the town 's new name the location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between santa fe and galveston bay as well as routes between northern mexico and the red river edwin waller was picked by lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital the original site was narrowed to 640 acres 259 ha that fronted the colorado river between two creeks shoal creek and waller creek which was later named in his honor the 14 block grid plan was bisected by a broad north south thoroughfare congress avenue running up from the river to capital square where the new texas state capitol was to be constructed a temporary one story capitol was erected on the corner of colorado and 8th streets on august 1 1839 the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held the grid plan waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown austin in 1840 a series of conflicts between the texas rangers and the comanches known as the council house fight and the battle of plum creek finally pushed the comanches westward mostly ending conflicts in central texas settlement in the area began to expand quickly travis county was established in 1840 and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades initially the new capital thrived but lamar 's political enemy sam houston used two mexican army incursions to san antonio as an excuse to move the government sam houston fought bitterly against lamar 's decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness the men and women who traveled mainly from houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well by 1840 the population had risen to 856 of whom nearly half fled from austin when congress recessed the resident black population listed in january of this same year was 176 the fear of austin 's proximity to the indians and mexico which still considered texas a part of their land created an immense motive for sam houston the first and third president of the republic of texas to relocate the capital once again in 1841 upon threats of mexican troops in texas houston raided the land office to transfer all official documents to houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the archive war but the people of austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed the documents stayed but the capital would temporarily move from austin to houston to washington on the brazos without the governmental body austin 's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s the voting by the fourth president of the republic anson jones and congress who reconvened in austin in 1845 settled the issue to keep austin the seat of government as well as annex the republic of texas into the united states in 1860 38 of travis county residents were slaves in 1861 with the outbreak of the american civil war voters in austin and other central texas communities voted against secession however as the war progressed and fears of attack by union forces increased austin contributed hundreds of men to the confederate forces the african american population of austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the emancipation proclamation in texas by union general gordon granger at galveston in an event commemorated as juneteenth black communities such as wheatville pleasant hill and clarksville were established with clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown the original post civil war settlements founded by former african american slaves west of the mississippi river in 1870 blacks made up 36 5 of austin 's population the postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth the opening of the houston and texas central railway h tc in 1871 turned austin into the major trading center for the region with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle the missouri kansas and texas mkt line followed close behind austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the chisholm trail and drovers pushed cattle north to the railroad cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export and a cotton gin engine was located downtown near the trains for ginning cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment however as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities in addition the areas east of austin took over cattle and cotton production from austin especially in towns like hutto and taylor that sit over the blackland prairie with its deep rich soils for producing cotton and hay in september 1881 austin public schools held their first classes the same year tillotson collegiate and normal institute now part of huston tillotson university opened its doors the university of texas at austin held its first classes in 1883 although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before during the 1880s austin gained new prominence as the state capitol building was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world in the late 19th century austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area and the first granite dam was built on the colorado river to power a new street car line and the new moon towers unfortunately the first dam washed away in a flood on april 7 1900 in the 1920s and 1930s austin launched a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city 's infrastructure and many of its parks in addition the state legislature established the lower colorado river authority lcra that along with the city of austin created the system of dams along the colorado river to form the highland lakes these projects were enabled in large part because the public works administration provided austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other texas cities during the early twentieth century a three way system of social segregation emerged in austin with anglos african americans and mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life including housing health care and education many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period such as the construction of new roads schools and hospitals were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation racial segregation increased in austin during the first half of the twentieth century with african americans and mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization in 1940 the destroyed granite dam on the colorado river was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam that formed lake mcdonald now called lake austin and which has withstood all floods since in addition the much larger mansfield dam was built by the lcra upstream of austin to form the flood control lake lake travis in the early 20th century the texas oil boom took hold creating tremendous economic opportunities in southeast texas and north texas the growth generated by this boom largely passed by austin at first with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th

the united states postal service operates several post offices in austin politics austin is known as an enclave of liberal politics in an otherwise conservative state so much so that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the people 's republic of austin by residents of other parts of texas and conservatives in the texas legislature since redistricting following the 2010 united states census austin has been divided between six congressional districts at the federal level texas 's 35th texas 's 25th texas 's 10th texas 's 21st texas 's 17th and texas 's 31st texas 's 35th congressional district is represented by democrat lloyd doggett the other five districts are represented by republicans of whom only one michael mccaul of the 10th district lives in austin as a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s central austin became a stronghold of the democratic party while the suburbs tend to vote republican a controversial turning point in the political history of the austin area was the 2003 texas redistricting opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan gerrymandering and the plan was challenged in court by democratic and minority activists of note the supreme court of the united states has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan the plan was subsequently upheld by a three judge federal panel in late 2003 and on june 28 2006 the matter was largely settled when the supreme court in a 7 2 decision upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a hispanic majority district in southwest texas this affected austin 's districting as u s rep lloyd doggett 's district u s congressional district 25 was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern travis county and several counties to its south and east overall the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole the city last went to a republican candidate in 2000 when former texas governor george w bush successfully ran for president in 2004 the democrats rebounded strongly as john kerry enjoyed a 14 0 margin over bush who once again won texas city residents have been supportive of alternative candidates for example ralph nader won 10 4 of the vote in austin in 2000 in 2003 the city adopted a resolution against the usa patriot act that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights of austin 's six state legislative districts three are strongly democratic and three are swing districts two of which are held by democrats and one of which is held by a republican however two of its three congressional districts the 10th and the 21st are presently held by republicans with only the 25th held by a democrat this is largely due to the 2003 redistricting which left downtown austin without an exclusive congressional seat of its own travis county was also the only county in texas to reject texas constitutional amendment proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin 40 for 60 against two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called austin home michael badnarik the libertarian party candidate and david

largest in the state of florida the city is situated on the banks of the st johns river in the first coast region of north florida about 25 miles 40 km south of the georgia state line and 340 miles 550 km north of miami prior to european settlement the jacksonville area was inhabited by native american people known as the timucua in 1564 the french established the short lived colony of fort caroline at the mouth of the st johns river becoming one of the earliest european settlements in the continental united states in 1822 a year after the united states gained florida from spain the town of jacksonville was platted along the st johns river established at a narrow point in the river known as wacca pilatka to the seminole and the cow ford to the british the enduring name derives from the first military governor of the florida territory and seventh president of the united states andrew jackson jacksonville is the cultural commercial and financial center of north florida a major

advanced materials regency centers stein mart web com fanatics gate petroleum haskell company interline brands sally corporation and southeastern grocers jacksonville is also home to several colleges and universities most notably the university of north florida located southeast of downtown history early history the area of the modern city of jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years on black hammock island in the national timucuan ecological and historic preserve a university of north florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the united states dating to 2500 bc in the 16th century the beginning of the historical era the region was inhabited by the mocama a coastal subgroup of the timucua people at the time of contact with europeans all mocama villages in present day jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the saturiwa centered around the mouth of the st johns river one early map shows a village called ossachite at the site of what is now downtown jacksonville this may be the earliest recorded name for that area french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river in 1562 calling it the river of may because he discovered it in may ribault erected a stone column near present day jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for france in 1564 ren goulaine de laudonni re established the first european settlement fort caroline on the st johns near the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro men ndez de avil s to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline on september 20 1565 a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st augustine attacked fort caroline and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it the spanish renamed the fort san mateo and following the ejection of the french st augustine 's position as the most important settlement in florida was solidified the location of fort caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the st johns river in 1964 spain ceded florida to the british in 1763 after the french and indian war and the british soon constructed the king 's road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish britain ceded control of the territory back to spain in 1783 after its defeat in the american revolutionary war and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821 american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town laying out the streets and plats they soon named the town jacksonville after andrew jackson led by isaiah d hart residents wrote a charter for a town government which was approved by the florida legislative council on february 9 1832 civil war and the gilded age during the american civil war jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from florida to aid the confederate cause the city was blockaded by union forces who gained control of the nearby fort clinch though no battles were fought in jacksonville proper the city changed hands several times between union and confederate forces the skirmish of the brick church in 1862 just outside jacksonville proper resulted in the first confederate victory in florida however union forces captured a confederate position at the battle of st johns bluff leading to the union occupation of jacksonville in 1862 in february 1864 union forces left jacksonville and confronted a confederate army at the battle of olustee resulting in a confederate victory union forces then retreated to jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war in march 1864 a confederate cavalry confronted a union expedition resulting in the battle of cedar creek warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war during reconstruction and the gilded age jacksonville and nearby st augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad president grover cleveland attended the sub tropical exposition in the city on february 22 1888 during his trip to florida this highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism the city 's tourism however was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks in addition extension of the florida east coast railway further south drew visitors to other areas from 1893 to 1938 jacksonville was the site of the florida old confederate soldiers and sailors home with a nearby cemetery great fire of 1901 on may 3 1901 downtown jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly in just eight hours it swept through 146 city blocks destroyed over 2000 buildings left about 10000 homeless and killed 7 residents the confederate monument in hemming park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire governor jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order on may 17 municipal authority resumed in jacksonville it is said the glow from the flames could be seen in savannah georgia and the smoke plumes seen in raleigh north carolina known as the great fire of 1901 it was one of the worst disasters in florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern united states architect henry john klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city the first multi story structure built by klutho was the dyal upchurch building in 1902 the st james building built on the previous site of the st james hotel that burned down was built in 1912 as klutho 's crowning achievement modern jacksonville in the 1910s new york based filmmakers were attracted to jacksonville 's warm climate exotic locations excellent rail access and cheap labor over the course of the decade more than 30 silent film studios were established earning jacksonville the title of winter film capital of the world however the emergence of hollywood as a major film production center ended the city 's film industry one converted movie studio site norman studios remains in arlington it has been converted to the jacksonville silent film museum at norman studios during this time jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center with companies such as barnett bank atlantic national bank florida national bank prudential gulf life afro american insurance independent life and american heritage life thriving in the business district the u s navy also became a major employer and economic force during the 1940s with the construction of three naval bases in the city jacksonville like most large cities in the united states suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after world war ii the construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs after world war ii the government of the city of jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war mayor w haydon burns' jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall civic auditorium public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride however the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class white flight left jacksonville with a much poorer population than before the city 's most populous ethnic group non hispanic white declined from 75 8 in 1970 to 55 1 by 2010 much of the city 's tax base dissipated leading to problems with funding education sanitation and traffic control within the city limits in addition residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958 a study recommended that the city of jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965 on december 29 1963 the hotel roosevelt fire killed 22 people making it the highest one day death toll in jacksonville one year later on september 10 1964 hurricane dora made landfall near st augustine causing major damage to buildings in north florida hurricane dora was the first hurricane to make a direct hit to north florida in the mid 1960s corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city 's officials who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network after a grand jury was convened to investigate 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign jacksonville consolidation led by j j daniel and claude yates began to win more support during this period from both inner city blacks who wanted more involvement in government and whites in the suburbs who wanted more services and more control over the central city in 1964 all 15 of duval county 's public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform lower taxes increased economic development unification of the community better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government when a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 voters approved the plan on october 1 1968 the governments merged to create the consolidated city of jacksonville fire police health welfare recreation public works and housing urban development were all combined under the new government in honor of the occasion then mayor hans tanzler posed with actress lee meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the bold new city of the south at florida 13 and julington creek the consolidation created a 900 square mile entity the better jacksonville plan promoted as a blueprint for jacksonville 's future and approved by jacksonville voters in 2000 authorized a half penny sales tax this would generate most of the revenue required for the 2 25 billion package of major projects that included road infrastructure improvements environmental preservation targeted economic development and new or improved public facilities the nfl awarded jacksonville an nfl franchise called the jacksonville jaguars on november 30 1993 in 2005 jacksonville hosted super bowl xxxix that was seen by an estimated 86 million viewers in october 2016 hurricane matthew caused major flooding and damage to jacksonville jacksonville beach atlantic beach and neptune beach the first such damage in the area since 2004 geography according to the united states census bureau the city has a total area of 874 3 square miles 2264 km2 making jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous united states of this 86 66 757 7 sq mi or 1962 km2 is land and 13 34 116 7 sq mi or 302 km2 is water jacksonville surrounds the town of baldwin nassau county lies to the north baker county lies to the west and clay and st johns county lie to the south the atlantic ocean lies to the east along with the jacksonville beaches the st johns river divides the city the trout river a major tributary of the st johns river is located entirely within jacksonville the state of florida including jacksonville is a huge flat plateau with a high water table and surface lakes are very shallow the united states geological survey states that the highest point in jacksonville is only 40 feet 12 2 meters above sea level making the area susceptible to flooding and storm surge soil composition is primarily sand and clay rather than limestone so very few sinkholes develop however deep large diameter sinkholes do occur cityscape architecture the architecture of jacksonville varies in style and is not defined by any one characteristic few structures in the city center predate the great fire of 1901 the city is home to one of the largest collections of prairie school style buildings outside of the midwest following the great fire of 1901 henry john klutho would come to influence generations of local designers with his works by both the chicago school championed by louis sullivan and the prairie school of architecture popularized by frank lloyd wright jacksonville is also home to a notable collection of mid century modern architecture local architects robert c broward taylor hardwick and william morgan adapted a range design principles including international style brutalism futurism and organicism all applied with an american interpretation generally referred to today as mid century modern design the architecture firms of reynolds smith hills rs h and kemp bunch jackson kbj have also contributed a number of important works to the city 's modern architectural movement jacksonville 's early predominant position as a regional center of business left an indelibly mark on the city 's skyline many of the earliest skyscrapers in the state were constructed in jacksonville dating as far back as 1902 the city last held the state height record from 1974 to 1981 the tallest building in downtown jacksonville 's skyline is the bank of america tower constructed in 1990 as the barnett center it has a height of 617 ft 188 m and includes 42 floors other notable structures include the 37 story wells fargo center with its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the jacksonville skyline originally built in 1972 74 by the independent life and accident insurance company and the 28 floor riverplace tower which when completed in 1967 was the tallest precast post tensioned concrete structure in the world climate like much of the south atlantic region of the united states jacksonville has a humid subtropical climate k ppen cfa with mild weather during winters and hot and humid weather during summers seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from may through september while the driest months are from november through april rainfall averages around 52 inches 1300 mm a year due to jacksonville 's low latitude and coastal location the city sees very little cold weather and winters are typically mild and sunny summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 f 12 c in january to 82 f 28 c in july high temperatures average 64 to 92 f 18 to 33 c throughout the year high heat indices are common for the summer months in the area with indices above 110 f 43 3 c possible the highest temperature recorded was 104 f 40 c on july 11 1879 and july 28 1872 it is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon these are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water combined with extremely high humidity during winter there can be hard freezes during the night such cold weather is usually short lived as the city averages only 10 to 15 nights at or below freezing and around 5 days where the high does not rise above 50 f 10 c the coldest temperature recorded at jacksonville international airport was 7 f 14 c on january 21 1985 jacksonville has recorded three days with measurable snow since 1911 most recently a one inch snowfall in december 1989 and flurries in december 2010 jacksonville has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane the city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871 however jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the gulf of mexico to the atlantic ocean or passing to the north or south in the atlantic and brushing past the area the strongest effect on jacksonville was from hurricane dora in 1964 the only recorded storm to hit the first coast with sustained hurricane force winds the eye crossed st augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph 180 km h making it a strong category 2 on the saffir simpson scale jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008 's tropical storm fay which crisscrossed the state bringing parts of jacksonville under darkness for four days similarly four years prior to this jacksonville was inundated by hurricane frances and hurricane jeanne which made landfall south of the area these tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to jacksonville hurricane floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to jacksonville beach during floyd the jacksonville beach pier was severely damaged and later demolished the rebuilt pier was later damaged by fay but not destroyed tropical storm bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004 spawning a minor tornado in the process on may 28 2012 jacksonville was hit by tropical storm beryl packing winds up to

despite its attractive location as a port and naval base san francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography the california gold rush brought a flood of treasure seekers known as forty niners as in 1849 with their sourdough bread in tow prospectors accumulated in san francisco over rival benicia raising the population from 1000 in 1848 to 25000 by december 1849 the promise of fabulous riches was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields leaving behind a forest of masts in san francisco harbor some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships saloons and hotels many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot by 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships by 1870 yerba buena cove had been filled to create new land buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings california was quickly granted statehood and the u s military built fort point at the golden gate and a fort on alcatraz island to secure the san francisco bay silver discoveries including

in 1852 and the bank of california in 1864 development of the port of san francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern u s rail system via the newly completed pacific

dry goods business and domingo ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture with chinese railroad workers drawn to old gold mountain creating the city 's chinatown quarter in 1870 asians made up 8 of the population the first cable cars carried san franciscans up clay street in 1873 the city 's sea of victorian houses began to take shape and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park resulting in plans for golden gate park san franciscans built schools churches theaters and all the hallmarks of civic life the presidio developed into the most important american military installation on the pacific coast by 1890 san francisco 's population approached 300000 making it the eighth largest city in the united states at the time around

francisco plague of 1900 1904 at 5 12 am on april 18 1906 a major earthquake struck san francisco and northern california as buildings collapsed from the shaking ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days with water mains out of service the presidio artillery corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks more than three quarters of the city lay in ruins including almost all of the downtown core contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands more than half of the city 's population of 400000 was left homeless refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in golden gate park the presidio on the beaches and elsewhere many fled permanently to the east bay rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid san franciscans opted for speed amadeo giannini 's bank of italy later to become bank of america provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated the influential san francisco planning and urban research association or spur was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake the earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire including pacific heights where many of the city 's wealthy rebuilt their homes in turn the destroyed mansions of nob hill became grand hotels city hall rose again in splendid beaux arts style and the city celebrated its rebirth at the panama pacific international exposition in 1915 it was during this period san francisco built some of its most important infrastructure civil engineer michael o'shaughnessy was hired by san francisco mayor james rolph as chief engineer for the city in september 1912 to supervise the construction of the twin peaks reservoir the stockton street tunnel the twin peaks tunnel the san francisco municipal railway the auxiliary water supply system and new sewers san francisco 's streetcar system of which the j k l m and n lines survive today was pushed to completion by o'shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927 it was the o'shaughnessy dam hetch hetchy reservoir and hetch hetchy aqueduct that would have the largest effect on san francisco an abundant water supply enabled san francisco to develop into the city it has become today in ensuing years the city solidified its standing as a financial capital in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash not a single san francisco based bank failed indeed it was at the height of the great depression that san francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects simultaneously constructing the san francisco oakland bay bridge and the golden gate bridge completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively it was in this period that the island of alcatraz a former military stockade began its service as a federal maximum security prison housing notorious inmates such as al capone and robert franklin stroud the birdman of alcatraz san francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a world 's fair the golden gate international exposition in 1939 40 creating treasure island in the middle of the bay to house it during world war ii the hunters point naval shipyard became a hub of activity and fort mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the pacific theater of operations the explosion of jobs drew many people especially african americans from the south to the area after the end of the war many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay the united nations charter creating the united nations was drafted and signed in san francisco in 1945 and in 1951 the treaty of san francisco officially ended the war with japan urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen led opposition the onset of containerization made san francisco 's small piers obsolete and cargo activity moved to the larger port of oakland the city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy the suburbs experienced rapid growth and san francisco underwent significant demographic change as large segments of the white population left the city supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from asia and latin america from 1950 to 1980 the city lost over 10 percent of its population over this period san francisco became a magnet for america 's counterculture beat generation writers fueled the san francisco renaissance and centered on the north beach neighborhood in the 1950s hippies flocked to haight ashbury in the 1960s reaching a peak with the 1967 summer of love in 1974 the zebra murders left at least 16 people dead in the 1970s the city became a center of the gay rights movement with the emergence of the castro as an urban gay village the election of harvey milk to the board of supervisors and his assassination along with that of mayor george moscone in 1978 bank of america completed 555 california street in 1969 and the transamerica pyramid was completed in 1972 igniting a wave of manhattanization that lasted until the late 1980s a period of extensive high rise development downtown the 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city an issue that remains today despite many attempts to address it the 1989 loma prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the bay area in san francisco the quake severely damaged structures in the marina and south of market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged embarcadero freeway and much of the damaged central freeway allowing the city to reclaim the embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the hayes valley neighborhood the last 20 years have seen two booms driven by the internet industry first was the dot com boom of the late 1990s startup companies invigorated the san francisco economy large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city followed by marketing design and sales professionals changing the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high rise development this time in the south of market district by 2000 the city 's population reached new highs surpassing the previous record set in 1950 when the bubble burst in 2001 many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the san francisco economy by the mid 2000s decade the social media boom had begun with san francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a popular place to live for people employed in silicon valley companies such as apple and google geography san francisco is located on the west coast of the united states at the north end of the san francisco peninsula and includes significant stretches of the pacific ocean and san francisco bay within its boundaries

dominating this area is sutro tower a large red and white radio and television transmission tower the nearby san andreas and hayward faults are responsible for much earthquake activity although neither physically passes through the city itself the san andreas fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis the threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city 's infrastructure development the city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction however there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage usgs has released the california earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in california san francisco 's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits entire neighborhoods such as the marina mission bay and hunters point as well as large sections of the embarcadero sit on areas of landfill treasure island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from tunneling through yerba buena island during the construction of the bay bridge such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes the resulting liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it as was evidenced in the marina district during the 1989 loma prieta earthquake most of the city 's natural watercourses such as islais creek and mission creek have been culverted and built over although the public utilities commission is studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks cityscape neighborhoods the historic center of san francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by market street and the

war ii the western addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including hayes valley the fillmore and japantown which was once the largest japantown in north america but suffered when its japanese american residents were forcibly removed and interned during world war ii the western addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its victorians largely intact including the famous painted ladies standing alongside alamo square to the south near the geographic center of the city is haight ashbury famously associated with 1960s hippie culture the haight is now home to some expensive boutiques and a few controversial chain stores although it still retains some bohemian character north of the western addition is pacific heights an affluent neighborhood that features the homes built by wealthy san franciscans in the wake of the 1906 earthquake directly north of pacific heights facing the waterfront is the marina a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the bay in the south east quadrant of the city is the mission district populated in the 19th century by californios and working class immigrants from germany ireland italy and scandinavia in the 1910s a wave of central american immigrants settled in the mission and in the 1950s immigrants from mexico began to predominate in recent years gentrification has changed the

embarcadero freeway reopened the downtown waterfront allowing for redevelopment the centerpiece of the port the ferry building while still receiving commuter ferry traffic has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace the port 's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism climate san francisco has a warm summer mediterranean climate k ppen csb characteristic of california 's coast with moist mild winters and dry summers san francisco 's weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the pacific ocean on the west side of the city and the water of san francisco bay to the north and east this moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year round climate with little seasonal temperature variation among major u s cities san francisco has the coolest daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures for june july and august during the summer rising hot air in california 's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the north pacific high through the golden gate which creates the city 's characteristic cool winds and fog the fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall which is the warmest time of the year because of its sharp topography and maritime influences san francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates the high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20 variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city they also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the sunset district for those who live on the eastern side of the city san francisco is sunnier with an average of 260 clear days and

have been leaving the city for the outer suburbs of the bay area or for california 's central valley by june 2 2015 the median rent was reported to be as high as 4225 the high cost of living is due in

year and moved to the top of the bluff the current courthouse was built on this site the fort was abandoned september 17 1853 no trace of it remains town development as a stop on the legendary chisholm trail fort worth was stimulated by the business of the cattle drives and became a brawling bustling town millions of head of cattle were driven north to market along this trail fort worth became the center of the cattle drives and later the ranching industry it was given the nickname of cowtown during civil war fort worth suffered from shortages of money food and supplies the population dropped as low a 175 but began to recover during reconstruction by 1872 jacob samuels william jesse boaz and william henry davis had opened general stores the next year khleber m van zandt established tidball van zandt and company which became fort worth national bank in 1884 panther city and hell 's half acre in 1875 the dallas herald published an article by a former fort worth lawyer robert e cowart who wrote that the decimation of fort worth 's population caused by the economic disaster and hard winter of 1873 had dealt a severe blow to the cattle industry added to the slowdown due to the railroad 's stopping the laying of track 30 miles 48 km outside of fort worth cowart said that fort worth was so slow that he saw a panther asleep in the street by the courthouse although an intended insult the name panther city was enthusiastically embraced when in 1876 fort worth recovered economically many businesses and organizations continue to use panther in their name a panther is set at the top of the police department badges the panther city tradition is also preserved in the names and design of some of the city 's geographical architectural features such as panther island in the trinity river the flat iron building the intermodal transportation center and in two or three sleeping panther statues in 1876 the texas and pacific railway finally was completed to fort worth stimulating a boom and transforming the fort worth stockyards into a premier center for the cattle wholesale trade migrants from the devastated war torn south continued to swell the population and small community factories and mills yielded to larger businesses newly dubbed the queen city of the prairies fort worth supplied a regional market via the growing transportation network fort worth became the westernmost railhead and a transit point for cattle shipment with the city 's main focus on cattle and the railroads local businessman louville niles formed the fort worth stockyards company in 1893 shortly thereafter the two biggest cattle slaughtering firms at the time armour and swift both established operations in the new stockyards with the boom times came a variety of entertainments and related problems fort worth had a knack for separating cattlemen from their money cowboys took full advantage of their last brush with civilization before the long drive on the chisholm trail from fort worth up north to kansas they stocked up on provisions from local merchants visited the colorful saloons for a bit of gambling and carousing then galloped northward with their cattle only to whoop it up again on their way back the town soon became home to hell 's half acre the biggest collection of saloons dance halls and bawdy houses south of dodge city the northern terminus of the chisholm trail giving fort worth the nickname of the paris of the plains template page 2016 certain sections of town were off limits for proper citizens shootings knifings muggings and brawls became a nightly occurrence cowboys were joined by a motley assortment of buffalo hunters gunmen adventurers and crooks hell 's half acre the acre expanded as more people were drawn to the town occasionally the acre was referred to as the bloody third ward after it was designated one of the city 's three political wards in 1876 by 1900 the acre covered four of the city 's main north south thoroughfares local citizens became alarmed about the activities electing timothy isaiah longhair jim courtright in 1876 as city marshal with a mandate to tame it courtright sometimes collected and jailed 30 people on a saturday night but allowed the gamblers to operate as they attracted money to the city after learning that train and stagecoach robbers such as the sam bass gang were using the area as a hideout he intensified law enforcement but certain businessmen advertised against too many restriction in the area as having bad effects on the legitimate businesses gradually the cowboys began to avoid the area as businesses suffered the city moderated its opposition courtright lost his office in 1879 despite crusading mayors such as h s broiles and newspaper editors such as b b paddock the acre survived because it generated income for the city all of it illegal and excitement for visitors longtime fort worth residents claimed the place was never as wild as its reputation but during the 1880s fort worth was a regular stop on the gambler 's circuit by such gambler gunmen as bat masterson doc holliday and the earp brothers wyatt morgan and virgil james earp the eldest of his brothers lived with his wife in fort worth during this period their house was at the edge of hell 's half acre at 9th and calhoun he often tended bar at the cattlemen 's exchange saloon in the uptown part of the city reforming citizens objected to the dance halls where men and women mingled by contrast the saloons or gambling parlors had primarily male customers in the late 1880s mayor broiles and county attorney r l carlock initiated a reform campaign in a public shootout on february 8 1887 jim courtright was killed on main street by short who claimed he was king of fort worth gamblers as courtright had been popular when short was jailed for his murder rumors floated of lynching him short 's good friend bat masterson came armed and spent the night in his cell to protect him the first prohibition campaign in texas was mounted in fort worth in 1889 helping to shut down the acre 's worst excesses other business development began in the area as well as residential another change was the influx of black residents excluded by state segregation from the business end of town and the more costly residential areas the city 's black citizens who numbered some 7000 of a total population of 50000 around 1900 settled into the southern portion of the city though some joined in the profitable vice trade to run for instance the black elephant saloon many others found legitimate work and bought homes the popularity and profitability of the acre declined and more derelicts and the homeless were seen on the streets by 1900 most of the dance halls and gamblers were gone cheap variety shows and prostitution became the chief forms of entertainment some politicians sought reforms under the progressive era in 1911 the reverend j frank norris launched an offensive against racetrack gambling in the baptist standard and used the pulpit of the first baptist church of fort worth to attack vice and prostitution norris used the acre to scourge the leadership of fort worth when he began to link certain fort worth businessmen with property in the acre and announce their names from his pulpit the battle heated up on february 4 1912 norris 's church was burned to the ground that evening his enemies tossed a bundle of burning oiled rags onto his porch but the fire was extinguished and caused minimal damage a month later the arsonists succeeded in burning down the parsonage in a sensational trial lasting a month norris was charged with perjury and arson in connection with the two fires he was acquitted but his continued attacks on the acre accomplished little until 1917 a new city administration and the federal government which was eyeing fort worth as a potential site for a major military training camp joined forces with the baptist preacher to bring down the final curtain on the acre the police department compiled statistics showing that 50 of the violent crime in fort worth occurred in the acre which confirmed respectable citizens' opinion of the area after camp bowie a world war i army training installation was located on the outskirts of fort worth in 1917 the military used martial law to regulate prostitutes and barkeepers of the acre fines and stiff jail sentences curtailed their activities by the time norris held a mock funeral parade to bury john barleycorn in 1919 the acre had become a part of fort worth history the name continues to be associated with the southern end of fort worth late 20th and early 21st centuries on march 28 2000 at 6 15 pm an f3 some estimates claim an f4 tornado smashed through downtown tearing many buildings

july 24 1701 by the french explorer and adventurer antoine de la mothe cadillac and a party of settlers during the 19th century it became an important industrial hub at the center of the great lakes region with expansion of the american automobile industry in the early 20th century the detroit area emerged as a significant metropolitan region within the united states the city became the fourth largest in the country for a period in the 1950s and 1960s suburban expansion continued with construction of a regional freeway system a great portion of detroit 's public transport was abandoned in favour of becoming an automotive city in the post war period which has gradually reversed since the 1970s due to industrial restructuring and loss of jobs in the auto industry detroit lost

their way around the hostile league of the iroquois and other friendlier iroquoian tribes to reach the straits of detroit in the 1630s the north side of lake erie was held by the huron and neutral peoples until the 1650s when the iroquois pushed both and the erie people away from the lake and beaver rich feeder streams in beaver wars during the six years 1649 1655 by the 1670s the war weakened iroquois laid claim to virtually all of northern ohio and lake country as far as the city as hunting grounds even south to the ohio river valley in northern kentucky and had absorbed many other iroquoian peoples by adoption after defeating them in war for the next hundred years virtually no british colonial or french action was contemplated without consultation with or consideration of iroquois' likely response in practice the location was too far west of the iroquois' center to prevent settlement and war on others poaching beaver pelts when french and indian war evicted france from canada it partially opened the way for british citizens to migrate west the governors wanted a british population in the conquered territory so the population began to surge furthermore britain had solicited countrymen to overshadow the french populous in the 1760s see below and main article british negotiations with the iroquois would both prove critical and lead to a crown policy limiting the west of the alleghenies settlements below the great lakes which gave many an american migrant to be a casus belli for supporting the american revolution the 1798 raids and resultant 1799 decisive sullivan expedition reopened the ohio country to westward emigration which began almost immediately and by 1800 white settlers were pouring westwards into and past the city european settlement the

and housing the federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work but when in june 1943 packard promoted three blacks to work next to whites on its assembly lines 25000 whites walked off the job the detroit race riot of 1943 took place three weeks after the packard plant protest over the course of three days 34 people were killed of whom 25 were african american and approximately 600 were injured 75 black people postwar era industrial mergers in the 1950s especially in the automobile sector increased oligopoly in the american auto industry detroit manufacturers such as packard and hudson merged into other companies and eventually disappeared at its peak population of 1849568 in the 1950 census the city was the 5th largest in the united states after new york city chicago philadelphia and los angeles as in other major american cities in the postwar era construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around detroit and pent up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization highways made commuting by car easier in 1956 detroit 's last heavily used electric streetcar line along the length of woodward avenue was removed and replaced with gas powered buses it was the last line of what had once been a 534 mile network of electric streetcars in 1941 at peak times a streetcar ran on woodward avenue every 60 seconds all of these changes in the area 's transportation system favored low density auto oriented development rather than high density urban development and industry also moved to the suburbs the metro detroit area developed as one of the most sprawling job markets in the united states by the 21st century and combined with poor public transport resulted in many jobs beyond the reach of urban low income workers in 1950 the city held about one third of the state 's population anchored by its industries and workers over the next sixty years the city 's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state 's population during the same time period the sprawling detroit metropolitan area which surrounds and includes the city grew to contain more than half of michigan 's population the shift of population and jobs eroded detroit 's tax base in june 1963 rev martin luther king jr gave a major speech in detroit that foreshadowed his i have a dream speech in washington d c two months later while the african american civil rights movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change longstanding tensions in detroit culminated in the twelfth street riot in july 1967 governor george w romney ordered the michigan national guard into detroit and president johnson sent in u s army troops the result was 43 dead 467 injured over 7200 arrests and more than 2000 buildings destroyed mostly in black residential and business areas thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods the affected district lay in ruins for decades it was the most costly riot in the united states on august 18 1970 the naacp filed suit against michigan state officials including governor william milliken charging de facto public school segregation the naacp argued that although schools were not legally segregated the city of detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools the naacp also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation which followed segregated neighborhoods the district court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling the sixth circuit court affirmed some of the decision holding that it was the state 's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area the u s supreme court took up the case february 27 1974 the subsequent milliken v bradley decision had wide national influence in a narrow decision the court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city 's school district milliken was perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period said myron orfield professor of law at the university of minnesota had that gone the other way it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of detroit 's current problems john mogk a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at wayne state university in detroit says everybody thinks that it was the riots in 1967 that caused the white families to leave some people were leaving at that time but really it was after milliken that you saw mass flight to the suburbs if the case had gone the other way it is likely that detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then 1970s and decline in november 1973 the city elected coleman young as its first black mayor after taking office young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department young also worked to improve detroit 's transportation system but tension between young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term in 1976 the federal government offered 600 million for building a regional rapid transit system under a single regional authority but the inability of detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system the city moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system which became known as the detroit people mover the gasoline crises of 1973 and 1979 also affected detroit and the u s auto industry buyers chose smaller more fuel efficient cars made by foreign makers as the price of gas rose efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry as their sales and market share declined automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city further eroding the tax base to counteract this the city used eminent domain to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city as mayor young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase investment in the city 's declining downtown the renaissance center a mixed use office and retail complex opened in 1977 this group of skyscrapers was an attempt to keep businesses in downtown young also gave city support to other large developments to attract middle and upper class residents back to the city despite the renaissance center and other projects the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the automobile dependent suburbs major stores and hotels closed and many large office buildings went vacant young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development and not doing enough to lower the city 's high crime rate and improve city services long a major population center and site of worldwide automobile manufacturing detroit has suffered a long economic decline produced by numerous factors like many industrial american cities detroit reached its population peak in the 1950 census the peak population was 1 8 million people following suburbanization industrial restructuring and loss of jobs as described above by the 2010 census the city had less than 40 percent of that number with just over 700000 residents the city has declined in population in each census since 1950 high unemployment was compounded by middle class flight to the suburbs and some residents leaving the state to find work the city was left with a higher proportion of poor in its population reduced tax base depressed property values abandoned buildings abandoned neighborhoods high crime rates and a pronounced demographic imbalance 1990s 2000s in 1993 young retired as detroit 's longest serving mayor deciding not to seek a sixth term that year the city elected dennis archer a former michigan supreme court justice archer prioritized downtown development and easing tensions with detroit 's suburban neighbors a referendum to allow casino

2017 the plans for the project call for mixed use residential on the blocks surrounding the arena and the renovation of the vacant 14 story eddystone hotel 21st century detroit 's protracted decline has resulted in severe urban decay and thousands of empty buildings around the city some parts of detroit are so sparsely populated that the city has difficulty providing municipal services the city has considered various solutions such as demolishing abandoned homes and buildings removing street lighting from large portions of the city and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations roughly half of the owners of detroit 's 305000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills resulting in about 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected nearly half of which was due to detroit the rest of the money would have been earmarked for wayne county detroit public schools and the library system in september 2008 mayor kwame kilpatrick who had served for six years resigned following felony convictions in 2013 kilpatrick was convicted on 24 federal felony counts including mail fraud wire fraud and racketeering and was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison the former mayor 's activities cost the city an estimated 20 million in 2013 felony bribery charges were brought against seven building inspectors in 2016 further corruption charges were brought against 12 principals a former school superintendent and supply vendor for a 12 million kickback scheme law professor peter henning argues that detroit 's corruption is not unusual for a city its size especially when compared with chicago the city 's financial crisis resulted in the state of michigan taking over administrative control of its government the state governor declared a financial emergency in march 2013 appointing kevyn orr as emergency manager on july 18 2013 detroit became the largest u s city to file for bankruptcy it was declared bankrupt by u s district court on

following month on december 11 the city officially exited bankruptcy the plan allowed the city to eliminate 7 billion in debt and invest 1 7 billion into improved city services one of the largest post

contributed to the city 's neighborhood revitalization especially in southwest detroit southwest detroit has experienced a thriving economy in recent years as evidenced by new housing increased business openings and the recently opened mexicantown international welcome center the city has numerous neighborhoods consisting of vacant properties resulting in low inhabited density in those areas

needing only minor repairs to deal with vacancy issues the city has begun demolishing the derelict houses razing 3000 of the total 10000 in 2010 but the resulting low density creates a strain on the city 's infrastructure to remedy this a number of solutions have been proposed including resident relocation from more sparsely populated neighborhoods and converting unused space to urban

than sixfold during the first half of the 20th century fed largely by an influx of european middle eastern lebanese assyrian chaldean and southern migrants to work in the burgeoning automobile

cities in the united states from the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of blacks moved to detroit to escape jim crow laws in the south and find jobs however they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city through violence laws and economic discrimination e g redlining white residents attacked black homes breaking windows starting fires and exploding bombs the pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs one of the implications of racial segregation which correlates with class segregation may be overall worse health for some populations

the ranking from number one most segregated to number four a 2011 op ed in the new york times attributed the decreased segregation rating to the overall exodus from the city cautioning that these areas may soon become more segregated this pattern already happened in the 1970s when apparent integration was actually a precursor to white flight and resegregation over a 60 year period white flight occurred in the city according to an estimate of the michigan metropolitan information center from 2008 to 2009 the percentage of non hispanic white residents increased from 8 4 to 13 3 some empty

forms part of the larger el paso las cruces csa with a population of 1053267 history the el paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years as evidenced by folsom points from hunter gatherers found at hueco tanks the evidence suggests 10000 to 12000 years of human habitation the earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers when the spanish arrived the manso suma and jumano tribes populated the area these were subsequently incorporated into the mestizo culture along with immigrants from central mexico captives from comancher a and gen zaros of various ethnic groups the mescalero apache were also present spanish explorer don juan de o ate was born in 1550 in zacatecas zacatecas mexico and was the first new spain mexico explorer known to have observed the rio grande near el paso in 1598 celebrating a thanksgiving mass there on april 30 1598 decades before the pilgrims' thanksgiving however the four survivors of the narv ez expedition lvar n ez cabeza de vaca alonso del castillo maldonado andr s dorantes de carranza and his enslaved moor estevanico are thought to have passed through the area in the mid 1530s el paso del norte the present day ju rez was founded on the south bank of the r o bravo del norte rio grande in 1659 by fray garcia de san francisco in 1680 the small village of el paso became the temporary base for spanish governance of the territory of new mexico as a result of the pueblo revolt until 1692 when santa fe was reconquered and once again became the capital el paso remained the largest settlement in new mexico until its cession to the us in 1848 when texas took possession of it with the compromise of 1850 the texas revolution 1836 was generally not felt in the region as the american population was small not being more than 10 of the population however the region was claimed by texas as part of the treaty signed with mexico and numerous attempts were made by texas to bolster these claims however the village which consisted of el paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self governed community with both representatives of the mexican and texan government negotiating for control until texas irrevocably took control in 1846 during this interregnum 1836 1848 americans nonetheless continued to settle the region as early as the mid 1840s alongside long extant hispanic settlements such as the rancho de juan mar a ponce de le n anglo settlers such as simeon hart and hugh stephenson had established thriving communities of american settlers owing allegiance to texas stephenson who had married into the local hispanic aristocracy established the rancho de san jos de la concordia which became the nucleus of anglo and hispanic settlement within the limits of modern day el paso in 1844 given the reclamations of the texas republic that wanted a chunk of the santa fe trade the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river a formal american settlement separate from old el paso del norte on the mexican side the present texas new mexico boundary placing el paso on the texas side was drawn in the compromise of 1850 el paso county was established in march 1850 with san elizario as the first county seat the united states senate fixed a boundary between texas and new mexico at the 32nd parallel thus largely ignoring history and topography a military post called the post opposite el paso meaning opposite el paso del norte across the rio grande was established in 1854 further west a settlement on coons' rancho called franklin became the nucleus of the future el paso texas a year later pioneer anson mills completed his plan of the town calling it el paso however the various communities never totalled more than several hundred residents with hispanics and americans holding an equal percentage of the population during the civil war a confederate presence was in the area until it was captured by the union california column in 1862 it was then headquarters for the 5th regiment california volunteer infantry until december 1864 after the civil war 's conclusion the town 's population began to grow as texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority el paso itself incorporated in 1873 encompassed the small area communities that had developed along the river in the 1870s a population of 23 non hispanic whites and 150 hispanics was reported with the arrival of the southern pacific texas and pacific and the atchison topeka and santa fe railroads in 1881 the population boomed to 10000 by the 1890 census with many anglo americans recent immigrants old hispanic settlers and recent arrivals from mexico the location of el paso as well as the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild boomtown known as the six shooter capital because of its lawlessness indeed prostitution and gambling flourished until world war i when the department of the army pressured el paso authorities to crack down on vice thus benefitting vice in neighboring ciudad ju rez with the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city 's geographic position the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing transportation and retail center of the us southwest in 1909 william howard taft and porfirio d az planned a summit in el paso texas and ciudad ju rez mexico an historic first meeting between a u s president and a mexican president and also the first time an american president would cross the border into mexico but tensions rose on both sides of the border including threats of assassination so the texas rangers 4000 u s and mexican troops u s secret service agents fbi agents and u s marshals were all called in to provide security frederick russell burnham the celebrated scout was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by john hays hammond who in addition to owning large investments in mexico was a close friend of taft from yale and a u s vice presidential candidate in 1908 on october 16 the day of the summit burnham and private c r moore a texas ranger discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the el paso chamber of commerce building along the procession route burnham and moore captured disarmed and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of taft and d az by 1910 the overwhelming number of people in the city were americans creating a settled environment however this period was short lived as the mexican revolution greatly impacted the city bringing an influx of refugees and capital to the bustling boom town spanish language newspapers theaters movie houses and schools were established many supported by a thriving mexican refugee middle class large numbers of clerics intellectuals and businessmen took refuge in the city particularly between 1913 and 1915 ultimately the violence of the mexican revolution followed with the large mexican diaspora which had fled into el paso in 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various mexican revolutionary societies planned staged and launched violent attacks against both texans and their political mexican opponents in el paso this state of affairs eventually led to the vast plan de san diego which resulted in the murder of 21 white citizens the subsequent reprisals by local militia soon caused an escalation of violence wherein it is estimated that approximately 300 mexicans and mexican americans lost their lives these actions affected almost every resident of the entire lower rio grande valley resulting in millions of dollars of losses the end result of the plan of san diego was long standing enmity between the two racial groups simultaneously other texans and americans gravitated to the city and by 1920 along with the us army troops the population exceeded 100000 and whites once again were in the clear majority nonetheless the city increased the segregation between mexicans and mexican americans with americans in reply the catholic church attempted to garner the mexican american community 's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations including the national catholic welfare fund in 1916 the census bureau reported el paso 's population as 53 mexican and 44 white mining and other industries gradually developed in the area the el paso and northeastern railway was chartered in 1897 to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas especially in southeastern new mexico territory the 1920s and 1930s saw the emergence of major business development in the city partially enabled by prohibition era bootlegging however the military demobilization an agricultural economic depression which hit places like el paso first before the larger great depression was felt in the big cities hit the city hard in turn as in the rest of the united states the depression era overall hit the city hard and el paso 's population declined through the end of world war ii with most of population losses coming from the white community nonetheless whites remained the majority to the 1940s during and following the war military expansion in the area as well as oil discoveries in the permian basin north america helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid 1900s copper smelting oil refining and the proliferation of low wage industries particularly garment making led the city 's growth additionally the departure of region 's rural population which was mostly white to cities like el paso brought a short term burst of capital and labor however this was balanced by additional departures of middle class americans to other parts of the country which offered new and better paying jobs in turn local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap mexican labor furthermore the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the native white population in turn seeking better paying jobs these migrants also moved to el paso by 1965 hispanics once again were a majority meanwhile the post war expansion slowed again in the 1960s but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with mexico geography el paso is at 31 47 25 n 106 25

250 mm per year much of which occurs during the summer from july through september and is predominantly caused by the north american monsoon during this period southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the pacific the gulf of california and the gulf of mexico into the region when this moisture moves into the el paso area and places to the southwest orographic lift from the mountains combined with strong daytime heating causes thunderstorms some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail across the region the sun shines 302 days per year on average in el paso 83 of daylight hours according to the national weather service from this the city is nicknamed the sun city due to its arid windy climate el paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season particularly during the springtime between march and early may with an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph 50 km h and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph 120 km h these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert causing loss of visibility el paso at 3800 ft 1200 m elevation also receives snow weather systems have produced over a foot 30 cm of snow on

and as a result many of which can be seen with brown leaves one example of el paso 's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early february 2011 which caused closures of schools businesses and city hall the snow which was light stopped after about a day but during the ensuing cold episode municipal utilities went into a crisis the high temperature on february 2 2011 was 15 f 9 c the lowest daily maximum on record in addition the low temperature on february 3 was 1 f 17 c breaking the 5 f 15 c monthly record low set during the cold wave of 1899 loss of desert vegetation such as mexican california palm trees oleanders and iceplants to the cold weather was one of the results two local power plants failed forcing el paso electric to institute rolling blackouts over several days and electric wires were broken causing localised blackouts many water utility pipes froze causing areas of the city to be without water for several days monthly means range from 44 8 f 7 1 c in december to 82 8 f 28 2 c in july but high temperatures typically peak in june before the monsoon arrives while daily low temperatures typically peak in july or early august with the higher humidity the monsoon brings translating to warmer nights on average there are 52 nights of at or below freezing lows 109 days of 90 f 32 c highs and 20 days of 100 f 38 c highs annually it

250 mm many parts of el paso are subject to occasional flooding during intense summer monsoonal thunderstorms in late july and early august 2006 up to 10 in 250 mm of rain fell in a week the flood control reservoirs overflowed and caused major flooding citywide the city staff estimated damage to public infrastructure at 21 million and to private property residential and commercial at 77 million much of the damage was associated with development in recent decades in arroyos protected by flood control dams and reservoirs and the absence of any storm drain utility in the city to handle the flow of rain water monthly statistics neighborhoods downtown and central el paso this part of town contains some of the city 's oldest and most historic neighborhoods located in the heart of the city it is

mills hosted by the portal to texas history memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the u s state of tennessee and the county seat of shelby county the city is located on the fourth chickasaw bluff south of the confluence of the wolf and mississippi rivers memphis had a population of 653450 in 2013 making it the largest city in the state of tennessee it is the largest city on the mississippi river the third largest in the greater southeastern united states and the 23rd largest in the united states the greater memphis metropolitan area including adjacent counties in mississippi and arkansas had a 2014 population of 1317314 this makes memphis the second largest metropolitan area in tennessee surpassed by metropolitan nashville memphis is the youngest of tennessee 's major cities founded in 1819 as a planned city by a group of wealthy americans including judge john overton and future president andrew jackson a resident of memphis is referred to as a memphian and the memphis region is known particularly to media outlets as memphis and the mid south history early history occupying a substantial bluff rising from the mississippi river the site of memphis has been a natural location for human settlement by varying cultures over thousands of years the area was known to be settled in the first millennium ad by people of the mississippian culture who had a network of communities throughout the mississippi river valley and its tributaries and built earthwork ceremonial and burial mounds the historic chickasaw indian tribe believed to be their descendants later occupied the site french explorers led by ren robert cavelier sieur de la salle and spanish explorer hernando de soto would encounter the chickasaw in that area in the 16th century j d l holmes writing in hudson 's four centuries of southern indians notes that there was a third strategic point in the late 18th century through which european powers could control american encroachment and their interference with indian matters after fort nogales present day vicksburg and fort confederaci n present day epes alabama chickasaw bluffs located on the mississippi river at the present day location of memphis spain and the united states vied for control of this site which was a favorite of the chickasaws in 1795 the spanish governor general of louisiana de carondelet sent his lieutenant governor manuel gayoso de lemos to negotiate and secure consent from local chickasaw inhabitants so that a spanish fort could be erected fort san fernando de las barrancas was the result holmes goes on to note that the consent was reached despite opposition from disappointed americans and a pro american faction of the chickasaws when the pro spanish faction signed the chickasaw bluffs cession and spain provided the chickasaws with a trading post fort san fernando de las barrancas remained a focal point of spanish activity until as holmes summarizes t he treaty of san lorenzo or pinckney 's treaty of 1795 implemented in march 1797 had as its result that all of the careful diplomatic work by spanish officials in louisiana and west florida which has succeeded for a decade in controlling the indians e g the choctaws was undone the united states gained the right to navigate the mississippi river and won control over the yazoo strip north of the thirty first parallel the spanish dismantled the fort shipping its lumber and iron to their locations in arkansas in 1796 the site became the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of tennessee located in the southwest united states but the area was largely occupied and controlled by the chickasaw nation captain isaac guion led an american force down the ohio river to claim the land arriving on july 20 1797 by this time the spanish had departed the fort 's ruins went unnoticed twenty years later when memphis was laid out as a city after the united states government paid the chickasaw for land 19th century the city of memphis was founded on may 22 1819 incorporated december 19 1826 by john overton james winchester and andrew jackson they named it after the ancient capital of egypt on the nile river memphis developed as a trade and transportation center in the 19th century because of its flood free location high above the mississippi river located in the low lying delta region along the river its outlying areas were developed as cotton plantations and the city became a major cotton market and brokerage center the cotton economy of the antebellum south depended on the forced labor of large numbers of african american slaves and memphis also developed as a major slave market for the domestic slave trade through the early 19th century one million slaves were transported from the upper south in a huge forced migration to newly developed plantation areas many were transported by steamboats along the ohio and mississippi rivers in 1857 the memphis and charleston railroad was completed connecting the atlantic coast of south carolina and this major mississippi river port it was the only east west railroad constructed across the southern states prior to the civil war this gave planters and cotton brokers access to the atlantic coast for shipping cotton to england a major market the city 's demographics changed dramatically in the 1850s and 1860s under waves of immigration and domestic migration due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the great famine ethnic irish made up 9 9 percent of the population in 1850 but 23 2 percent in 1860 when the total population was 22623 they had encountered considerable discrimination in the city but by 1860 the irish constituted most of the police force they also gained many elected and patronage positions in the democratic party city government and an irish man was elected as mayor before the civil war at that time representatives were elected to the city council from 30 wards the elite were worried about corruption in this system and that so many saloonkeepers were active in the wards german immigrants also made this city a destination following the 1848 revolutions both the irish and germans were mostly catholic adding another element to demographic change in this formerly protestant city tennessee seceded from the union in june 1861 and memphis briefly became a confederate stronghold union ironclad gunboats captured the city in the naval battle of memphis on june 6 1862 and the city and state were occupied by the union army for the duration of the war the union army commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded confederate veterans from office which shifted political dynamics in the city as the war went on as memphis was used as a union supply base associated with nearby fort pickering it continued to prosper economically throughout the war meanwhile confederate general nathan bedford forrest harassed union forces in the area the war years contributed to additional dramatic changes in city population the presence of the union army attracted many fugitive slaves who escaped from surrounding rural plantations so many sought protection behind union lines that the army set up contraband camps to accommodate them the black population of memphis increased from 3000 in 1860 when the total population was 22623 to nearly 20000 in 1865 with most settling south of what was then the city limits the white population was also increasing but not to the same degree the total population in 1870 was 40220 after thousands of blacks had left the city they numbered 15000 that year or 37 4 of the total see census table in demographics section postwar years reconstruction and democratic control the rapid demographic changes added to the stress of war and occupation and uncertainty about who was in charge resulted in growing tensions between the irish policemen and black union soldiers following the war in three days of rioting in early may 1866 the memphis riot erupted in which white mobs made up of policemen firemen and other mostly ethnic irish attacked and killed 46 blacks wounding 75 and injuring 100 persons raped several women and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in south memphis much of the settlement was left in ruins two whites were killed in the riot many blacks permanently fled memphis after the riot especially as the freedmen 's bureau continued to have difficulty in protecting them their population fell to about 15000 by 1870 or 37 5 of the city which then had a total population of 40226 see census table in demographics section historian barrington walker suggests that the irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to whiteness they were trying to separate themselves from blacks in the underclass the main fighting participants were ethnic irish decommissioned black union soldiers and newly emancipated freedmen from the african american community walker suggests that most of the mob were not in direct economic conflict with the blacks as by then the irish had attained better jobs but the irish were establishing dominance over the freedmen in memphis unlike disturbances in some other cities ex confederate veterans were generally not part of the attacks against blacks the outrages of the riot in memphis and a similar one in new orleans in september the latter did include confederate veterans resulted in support in the north for congress to pass the reconstruction act and the fourteenth amendment in the 1870s a series of yellow fever epidemics devastated memphis with the disease being carried by river passengers along the waterways during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 in memphis tennessee more than 5000 people were listed in the official register of deaths between july 26 and november 27 the vast majority of them died of yellow fever making the epidemic in the city of 40000 people one of the most traumatic and severe in urban united states' history within four days of the memphis board of health 's declaration of a yellow fever outbreak 20000 residents had fled the city the panic ensuing left the poverty stricken the working classes and the african american community at the disposal of the epidemic those who remained in memphis relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick by the end of the year more than 5000 were confirmed dead in memphis the new orleans health board listed not less than 4600 dead the mississippi valley experienced 120000 cases of yellow fever with 20000 deaths the 15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted the city of memphis and as a result their charter was revoked by 1870 memphis 's population of 40000 was almost double that of nashville and atlanta ranking it second only to new orleans as the largest city in the south the population of memphis continued to grow after 1870 even when the panic of 1873 hit the us particularly the south very hard the panic of 1873 allowed memphis 's underclasses to swell amidst the poverty and hardship the panic wrought giving further credence to memphis being a rough shiftless city also memphis had a reputation for being a dirty city leading up to outbreak in 1878 two yellow fever epidemics cholera and malaria had given memphis a reputation as a sickly city and a filthy one it was unheard of for a city with a population as large as the one in memphis to have no waterworks the city still relied entirely on the river and rain cisterns to collect water and there was no way to remove sewage the combination of a swelling population especially of lower and working classes and the abysmal health and sanitary conditions of memphis made the city ripe for a serious epidemic the first case to go on record for the public was when mrs kate bionda an owner of an italian snack house died of the fever on august 13 hers was officially reported by the board of health on august 14 as the first case of yellow fever in the city a massive panic ensued the same trains and steamboats that brought thousands into memphis now carried away over 25000 memphians more than half of the population in a span of five days on august 23 the board of health finally declared a yellow fever epidemic in memphis and the city collapsed hemorrhaging its population in july of that year the city boasted a population of 47000 by september 19000 remained and 17000 of them had yellow fever the only people left in the city were the lower classes like the german and irish immigrant workers and african americans neither of these two groups had the capacity to flee the city like the middle and upper class whites of memphis and thus they were subjected to a city of death immediately following the board of health 's declaration a citizen 's relief committee was formed by charles g fisher and proceeded to organize the city into refugee camps the committee 's main priority was separating the poor from the city and isolating them into refugee camps also the howard association formed specifically for yellow fever epidemics in new orleans and memphis organized nurses and doctors within memphis and throughout the country in response to the outbreak they stayed at the peabody hotel the only hotel to keep its doors open during the epidemic crosby 60 and from there were assigned to their respective infected districts physicians of the epidemic reported seeing as many as 100 to 150 patients daily the sisters of st mary 's hospital played an important role during the epidemic caring for the lower classes already home to a girls' school and church orphanage the sisters of st mary 's also sought to provide care for the canfield asylum a home for black children each day the sisters alternated caring for the orphans at st mary 's delivering children to the canfield asylum and taking soup and medicine on house calls to patients between september 9 and october 4 sister constance and three other sisters fell victim to the epidemic themselves they later became known as the martyrs of memphis at long last on october 28 a killing frost fell and a message was sent to memphians scattered all over the country to come home though yellow fever cases would continue to appear in the pages of elmwood cemetery 's burial record as late as february 29 the epidemic itself seemed quieted the board of health declared the epidemic which caused over 20000 deaths and financial losses of nearly 200 million at an end on november 27 a general citizen 's meeting was called at the greenlaw opera house to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve and die over the next year property tax revenues collapsed and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts as a result of this crisis memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a taxing district from 1878 1893 despite the unfortunately losing its charter and 75 of its population a new era of sanitation arose in memphis a new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements perhaps the most significant effect the yellow fever had on memphis was its demographic changes nearly all of memphis 's upper and middle classes vanished depriving the city of its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life similar to other large southern cities like new orleans charleston and atlanta this put memphis in a unique position one in which poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in reestablishing the city the epidemic had made memphis a less cosmopolitan place with an economy that serviced the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black southerners the 1890 election was strongly contested resulting in opponents of the d p hadden faction working to deprive them of votes by disenfranchising blacks the state had enacted several laws including the requirement of poll taxes that served to disenfranchise many blacks although political party factions in the future sometimes paid poll taxes to enable blacks to vote african americans lost their last positions on the city council in this election and were forced out of the police force they did not recover the ability to exercise the franchise until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid 1960s historian l b wrenn suggests the heightened political hostility of the democratic contest and related social tensions contributed to a white mob lynching three black grocers in memphis in 1892 journalist ida b wells of memphis investigated the lynchings as one of the men killed was a friend of hers she demonstrated that these and other lynchings were more often due to economic and social competition than any criminal offenses by black men her findings were so controversial and aroused so much anger that she was forced to move away from the city although she continued to investigate and publish the abuses of lynching businessmen were eager to increase city population after the losses of 1878 79 and supported annexation of new areas to the city this was passed in 1890 before the census the annexation measure was finally approved by the state legislature through a compromise achieved with real estate magnates and the area annexed was slightly smaller than first proposed in 1893 the city was rechartered with home rule which restored its ability to enact taxes although the state legislature established a cap rate although commission government was retained and enlarged to five commissioners democratic politicians regained control from the business elite the commission form of government was believed effective in getting things done but it reduced representation of the city 's full population 20th century in terms of its economy memphis developed as the world 's largest spot cotton market and the world 's largest hardwood lumber market both commodity products of the mississippi delta into the 1950s it was the world 's largest mule market attracting workers from rural areas as well as new immigrants from 1900 to 1950 the city increased nearly fourfold in population from 102350 to 396000 residents from the 1910s to the 1950s memphis was a place of machine politics under the direction of e h boss crump he gained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city the city retained a form of commission government until 1967 and patronage flourished under crump per the publisher 's summary of l b wrenn 's study of the period this centralization of political power in a small commission aided the efficient transaction of municipal business but the public policies that resulted from it tended to benefit upper class memphians while neglecting the less affluent residents and neighborhoods the city installed a revolutionary sewer system and upgraded sanitation and drainage to prevent another epidemic pure water from an artesian well was discovered in the 1880s securing the city 's water supply the commissioners developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national city beautiful movement but did not encourage heavy industry which might have provided substantial employment for the working class population the lack of representation in city government resulted in the poor and minorities being underrepresented the majority controlled the election of all the at large positions memphis did not become a home rule city until 1963 although the state legislature had amended the constitution in 1953 to provide home rule for cities and counties before that the city had to get state bills approved in order to change its charter and for other policies and programs since 1963 it can change the charter by popular approval of the electorate during the 1960s the city was at the center of civil rights issues as its large african american population had been affected by state segregation practices and disenfranchisement in the early 20th century african american residents drew from the civil rights movement to improve their lives in 1968 a city sanitation workers' strike began for living wages and better working conditions the workers were overwhelmingly african american they marched to gain public awareness and support for their plight the danger of their work and the struggles to support families with their low pay their drive for better pay had been met with resistance by the city government rev martin luther king jr of the southern christian leadership conference known for his leadership in the non violent movement came to lend his support to the workers' cause he stayed at the lorraine motel in the city where he was assassinated by a sniper on april 4 1968 the day after giving his prophetic i 've been to the mountaintop speech at the mason temple grief stricken and enraged after learning of king 's murder many african americans in the city rioted looting and destroying businesses and other facilities some by arson the governor ordered tennessee national guardsmen into the city within hours where small roving bands of rioters continued to be active fearing the violence more of the middle class began to leave the city for the suburbs in 1970 the census bureau reported memphis' population as 60 8 white and 38 9 black suburbanization was attracting wealthier residents to newer housing outside the city after the riots and court ordered busing in 1973 to achieve desegregation of public schools about 40000 of the system 's 71000 white students abandon ed the system in four years the city now has a majority black population the larger metropolitan area is narrowly majority white memphis is well known for its cultural contributions to the identity of the american south many renowned musicians grew up in and around memphis and moved to chicago and other areas from the mississippi delta carrying their music with them

and seven elected from geographic districts following passage of the voting rights act of 1965 civil rights activists challenged the at large is electoral system in court because it made it more

positions are elected from nine geographic districts seven are single member districts and two elect three members each jim strickland is the city 's current mayor elected on october 8 2015 he is a former memphis city councilman the previous mayor of the city of memphis was a c wharton since the late 20th century regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated shelby county and memphis into a metropolitan government as nashville davidson county did in 1963 consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of memphis and shelby county under the state law for dual voting on such measures the referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions black leaders including then shelby county commissioner joe ford and national civil rights leader al sharpton opposed the consolidation according to the plaintiffs' expert marcus pohlmann these leaders tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard won civil rights victories of the past in october 2010 before the vote eight shelby county citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the shelby county elections commission against the dual voting requirement plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together rather than as separate elections city voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50 8 in favor county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85 against the state argued that with the election decided the lawsuit should be dismissed but the federal court disagreed by late 2013 in pre trial actions both sides were trying to disqualify the other 's experts in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting the experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy the defendants' expert todd donovan did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that african american voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration taxation service provision and other policy questions he noted in the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum in 2014 the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions' votes were counted together in total voting 64 of voters opposed the consolidation in the last week of december 2014 the u s sixth district court of appeals upheld that decision ruling that in this election the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual majority vote requirement with the vote counts combined before the referendum the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation as noted below in 2011 the memphis city council voted to dissolve its city school board and consolidate with the shelby county school system without the collaboration or agreement of shelby county the city had authority for this action under tennessee state laws that differentiate between city and county powers crime in the 21st century memphis has struggled to

with the slave trade rum fish salt and tobacco being particularly important the embargo act of 1807 adopted during the napoleonic wars and the war of 1812 significantly curtailed boston 's harbor activity although foreign trade returned after these hostilities boston 's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim manufacturing became an important component of the city 's economy and by the mid 19th century the city 's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance until the early 20th century boston remained one of the nation 's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its garment production and leather goods industries a network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories later a dense network of railroads furthered the region 's industry and commerce during this period boston flourished

1890 the city tripled its area through land reclamation by filling in marshes mud flats and gaps between wharves along the waterfront the largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century beginning in 1807 the crown of beacon hill was used to fill in a 50 acre 20 ha mill pond that later became the haymarket square area the present day state house sits atop this lowered beacon hill reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the south end the west end the financial district and chinatown after the great boston fire of 1872 workers used building

for cheaper labor elsewhere boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects under the direction of the boston redevelopment authority bra which was established in 1957 in 1958 bra initiated a project to improve the historic west end neighborhood extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition the bra subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its

patient care schools such as boston college boston university the harvard medical school northeastern university wentworth institute of technology berklee college of music and boston conservatory

subsequently known as the denny party arrived from illinois via portland oregon on the schooner exact at alki point on november 13 1851 the settlement was moved to the eastern shore of elliott bay and named seattle in 1852 after chief si ahl or chief sealth or chief se atle pronounced see atle with a guttural atle sound of the local duwamish and suquamish tribes logging was seattle 's first major industry but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to alaska during the klondike gold rush growth after world war ii was partially due to the local boeing company which established seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing the seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s with companies like microsoft becoming established in the region in 1994 internet retailer amazon was founded in seattle the stream of new software biotechnology and internet companies led to an economic revival which increased the city 's

hendrix and the alternative rock subgenre grungepopularized by kurt cobain a singer from aberdeen along with microsoft developers paul allen and bill gates history founding archaeological excavations suggest that native americans have inhabited the seattle area for at least 4000 years by the time the first european settlers arrived the people subsequently called the duwamish tribe occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around elliott bay the first european to visit the seattle area was george vancouver in may 1792 during his 1791 95 expedition to chart the pacific northwest in 1851 a large party led by luther collins made a location on land at the mouth of the duwamish river they formally claimed it on september 14 1851 thirteen days later members of the collins party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the denny party members of the denny party claimed land on alki point on september 28 1851 the rest of the denny party set sail from portland oregon and landed on alki point during a rainstorm on november 13 1851 duwamps 1852 1853 after a difficult winter most of the denny party relocated across elliott bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present day pioneer square naming this new settlement duwamps charles terry and john low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it new york but renamed new york alki in april 1853 from a chinook word meaning roughly by and by or someday for the next few years new york alki and duwamps competed for dominance but in time alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers david swinson doc maynard one of the founders of duwamps was the primary advocate to name the settlement after chief sealth seattle of the duwamish and suquamish tribes incorporations the name seattle appears on official washington territory papers dated may 23 1853 when the first plats for the village were filed in 1855 nominal land settlements were established on january 14 1865 the legislature of territorial washington incorporated the town of seattle with a board of trustees managing the city the town of seattle was

government the corporate seal of the city of seattle carries the date 1869 and a likeness of chief sealth in left profile timber town seattle has a history of boom and bust cycles like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources seattle has risen several times economically then gone into precipitous decline but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure the first such boom covering the early years of the city rode on the lumber industry during this period the road now known as yesler way won the nickname skid road supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to henry yesler 's sawmill the later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider american lexicon as skid row like much of the american west seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti chinese riots of 1885 1886 this violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the chinese from seattle anti chinese riots also occurred in tacoma in 1900 asians were 4 2 of the population authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder seattle achieved sufficient economic success that when the great seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place finance company washington mutual for example was founded in the immediate wake of the fire however the panic of 1893 hit seattle hard gold rush world war i and the great depression the second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the klondike gold rush which ended the depression that had begun with the panic of 1893 in a short time seattle became a major transportation center on july 14 1897 the s s portland docked with its famed ton of gold and seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in alaska and the yukon few of those working men found lasting wealth however it was seattle 's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run along with seattle other cities like everett tacoma port townsend bremerton and olympia all in the puget sound region became competitors for exchange rather than mother lodes for extraction of precious metals the boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new seattle companies and products in 1907 19 year old james e casey borrowed 100 from a friend and founded the american messenger company later ups other seattle companies founded during this period include nordstrom and eddie bauer seattle brought in the olmsted brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards the gold rush era culminated in the alaska yukon pacific exposition of 1909 which is largely responsible for the layout of today 's university of washington campus a shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during world war i making seattle somewhat of a company town the subsequent retrenchment led to the seattle general strike of 1919 the first general strike in the country a 1912 city development plan by virgil bogue went largely unused seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the great depression experiencing some of the country 's harshest labor strife in that era violence during the maritime strike of 1934 cost seattle much of its maritime traffic which was rerouted to the port of los angeles seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who starting in 1902 opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies his activities soon expanded and the thrifty greek went on and became one of america 's greatest theater and movie tycoons between pantages and his rival john considine seattle was for a while the western united states' vaudeville mecca b marcus priteca the scottish born and seattle based architect built several theaters for pantages including some in seattle the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses but many other theaters survive in other cities of the u s often retaining the pantages name seattle 's surviving paramount theatre on which he collaborated was not a pantages theater post war years aircraft and software war work again brought local prosperity during world war ii this time centered on boeing aircraft the war dispersed the city 's numerous japanese american businessmen due to the japanese american internment after the war the local economy dipped it rose again with boeing 's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the century 21 exposition the 1962 world 's fair another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s at a time when boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises loss of government contracts and costs and delays associated with the boeing 747 many people left the area to look for work elsewhere and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading will the last person leaving seattle turn out the lights seattle remained the corporate headquarters of boeing until 2001 when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities the headquarters were moved to chicago the seattle area is still home to boeing 's renton narrow body plant where the 707 720 727 and 757 were assembled and the 737 is assembled today and everett wide body plant assembly plant for the 747 767 777 and 787 the company 's credit union for employees becu remains based in the seattle area though it is now open to all residents of washington as prosperity began to return in the 1980s the city was stunned by the wah mee massacre in 1983 when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the international district seattle 's

is classified as oceanic or temperate marine with cool wet winters and mild relatively dry summers the city and environs are part of usda hardiness zone 8b with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent puget sound greater pacific ocean and lake washington thus extreme heat waves are rare in the seattle area as are very cold temperatures below about 15 f the seattle area is the cloudiest region of the united states due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent pacific ocean despite having a reputation for frequent rain seattle receives less precipitation than many other us cities like chicago or new york city however unlike many other us cities seattle has many more rain days when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days in an average year at least 0 01 inches 0 25 mm of precipitation falls on 150 days more than nearly all u s cities east of the rocky mountains it is cloudy 201 days out of the year

of the puget sound receives 56 4 in 1430 mm of precipitation annually conversely the northeastern portion of the olympic peninsula which lies east of the olympic mountains is located within the olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer and significantly dryer air sequim washington nicknamed sunny sequim is located approximately 40 miles northwest of downtown seattle and receives just 16 51 of annual precipitation more comparable to that of los angeles oftentimes an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the puget sound to the north and east of sequim on average sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to

somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations locations to the south of seattle received more with olympia and chehalis receiving 14 to 18 in 36 to 46 cm another moderate snow event occurred from december 12 25 2008 when over one foot 30 cm of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks when temperatures remained below 32 f 0 c causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for

in 145 cm of snow the most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold the puget sound convergence zone is an important feature of seattle 's weather in the convergence zone air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south both streams of air originate over the pacific ocean airflow is split by the olympic mountains to seattle 's west then reunited to the east when the air currents meet they are forced upward resulting in convection thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town but seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers the hanukkah eve wind storm in december 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph 111 km h an event that was not caused by the puget sound convergence zone and was widespread across the pacific northwest one of many exceptions to seattle 's reputation as a damp location occurs in el ni o years when marine weather systems track as far south as california and little precipitation falls in the puget sound area since the region 's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months el ni o winters

at the facility in 1957 as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968 resulted in the contamination of some parts of denver to varying degrees with plutonium 239 a harmful radioactive substance with a half life of 24200 years a study by the jefferson county health director dr carl johnson in 1981 linked the contamination to an increase in birth defects and

the nashville davidson murfreesboro columbia combined statistical area a larger trade area was 1951644 history the town of nashville was founded by james robertson john donelson and a party of overmountain men in 1779 near the original cumberland settlement of fort nashborough it was named for francis nash the american revolutionary war hero nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location accessibility as a port on the cumberland river a tributary of the ohio river and its later status as a major railroad center by 1800 the city had 345 residents including 136 african american slaves and 14 free blacks in 1806 nashville was incorporated as a city and became the county seat of davidson county tennessee in 1843 the city was named the permanent capital of the state of tennessee by 1860 when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the south antebellum nashville was a very prosperous city the city 's significance as a shipping port made it a desirable prize as a means of controlling important river and railroad transportation routes in february 1862 nashville became the first state capital to fall to union troops the state was occupied by union troops for the duration of the war the battle of nashville december 15 16 1864 was a significant union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war it was also the final major military action of the war which afterwards became almost entirely a war of attrition consisting largely of guerrilla raids and small skirmishes with the confederate forces in the deep south almost constantly in retreat within a few years after the civil war the nashville chapter of the ku klux klan was founded by confederate veteran john w morton meanwhile the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and also developed a solid manufacturing base the post civil war years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to nashville and davidson county these healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical style buildings which can still be seen around the downtown area 20th century to present circa 1950 the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for election of city council members from single member districts rather than at large voting this change was supported because at large voting diluted the minority population 's political power in the city they could seldom gain a majority of the population to support a candidate of their choice apportionment under the single member districts meant that some districts had black majorities in 1952 after passage of the new charter african american attorneys z alexander looby and robert e lillard were elected to the city council the first to gain office since 1911 after disenfranchisement had been achieved by the state government the years after world war ii were a time of rapid suburbanization as new housing was built outside the city limits this resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities which the county found difficult to provide at the same time suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services supported only by city taxpayers after years of discussion a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government it failed to gain approval although it was supported by elected leaders of both jurisdictions county judge beverly briley of davidson and mayor ben west of nashville following the referendum 's failure nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base this increased uncertainty among residents and created resentment among many suburban communities under the second charter for metropolitan government which was approved in 1962 two levels of service provision were proposed the general services district and the urban services district to provide for a differential in tax levels residents of the urban services district had a full range of city services the areas that made up the general services district however had a lower tax rate until full services were provided this helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region in 1963 nashville consolidated its government with davidson county forming a metropolitan government the membership on the metro council the legislative body was increased from 21 to 40 seats of these five members are elected at large and 35 are elected from single member districts each to serve a term of four years since the 1970s the city and county have experienced tremendous growth particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then mayor and later tennessee governor phil bredesen he made urban renewal a priority and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks including the

party kept the seat in democratic hands however they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972 when the republican candidate gained only 38 of the vote even as nixon carried the district

name of the estate in county longford on which the calvert family lived in ireland baltimore is an anglicization of the irish name baile an t mh ir meaning town of the big house 17th century in 1608 captain john smith traveled 210 miles from jamestown to the uppermost chesapeake bay leading the first european expedition to the patapsco river the name patapsco is derived from pota psk ut which translates to backwater or tide covered with froth in algonquian dialect a quarter century after john smith 's voyage english colonists began to settle in maryland the area constituting the modern city of baltimore and its metropolitan area was first settled by david jones in 1661 he claimed the area known today as harbor east on the east bank of the jones falls stream which flows south into baltimore 's inner harbor in the early 1600s the immediate baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated if at all by native americans the baltimore county area northward was used as hunting grounds by the susquehannocks living in the lower susquehanna river valley who controlled all of the upper tributaries of the chesapeake but refrained from much contact with powhatan in the potomac region pressured by the susquehannocks the piscataway tribe of algonquians stayed well south of the baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the potomac river in what is now charles and southern prince george 's south of the fall line the baltimore area had been inhabited by native americans since at least the 10th millennium bc when paleo indians first settled in the region one paleo indian site and several archaic period and woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in baltimore including four from the late woodland period during the late woodland period the archaeological culture that is called the potomac creek complex resided in the area from baltimore to the rappahannock river in virginia the current baltimore on the patapsco river was established in

became part of harford county in 1674 the general assembly passed an act for erecting sic a court house and prison in each county within this province the site of the court house and jail for baltimore county was evidently old baltimore near the bush river we know this because in 1683 the general assembly passed an act for advancement of trade to establish towns ports and places of trade within the province one of the towns established by the act in baltimore county was on bush river on town land near the court house the court house on the bush river referenced in the 1683 act was in all likelihood the one created by the 1674 act old baltimore was in existence as early as 1674 but we do n't know with certainty what if anything happened on the site prior to that year the exact location of old baltimore was lost for years it was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present day aberdeen proving grounds apg a u s army testing facility apg s cultural

canada which he found too cold and difficult for habitation baltimore grew swiftly in the 18th century as a granary for sugar producing colonies in the caribbean the profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food it was also during this time when baltimore saw the establishment of its public market system in 1763 lexington market founded in 1782 continues to be known as one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in the united states today other firsts include the first post office system in the united states inaugurated in 1774 and the first

and eastern regions along with baltimore all of which benefited greatly from both the tobacco and slave trades when union soldiers from the sixth massachusetts state militia and some unarmed pennsylvania state militia known as the washington brigade from philadelphia with their band marched through the city at the start of the war confederate sympathizers attacked the troops which led to the first bloodshed in the civil war during the baltimore riot of 1861 four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot which caused union troops to later occupy baltimore in may under

under the k ppen classification baltimore lies within the humid subtropical climate zone cfa with four distinct seasons and is part of usda plant hardiness zones 7b and 8a winters are chilly but variable with sporadic snowfall january has a daily average of 35 8 f 2 1 c though temperatures reach 50 f 10 c rather often and drop below 20 f 7 c when arctic air masses affect the area the average seasonal snowfall is 20 1 inches 51 cm but it varies greatly depending on the winter with some seasons seeing minimal snow while others see several major nor'easters due to lessened urban heat island uhi as compared to the city proper and distance from the moderating chesapeake bay the outlying and inland parts of the baltimore metro area are usually cooler especially at night than the city proper and the coastal towns thus in the northern and western suburbs winter snowfall is more significant and some areas average more than 30 in 76 cm of snow per winter it is by no means uncommon for the rain snow line to set up in the metro area freezing rain and sleet occurs a few times each winter in the area as warm air overrides cold air at the low to mid levels of the atmosphere when the wind blows from the east the cold air gets dammed against the mountains to the west and the result is freezing rain or sleet spring and autumn are warm with spring being the wettest season in terms of the number of precipitation days summers are hot and humid with a daily average in july of 80 7 f 27 1 c and the combination of heat and humidity leads to rather frequent thunderstorms a southeasterly bay breeze off the chesapeake often occurs on summer afternoons when hot air rises over inland areas prevailing winds from the southwest interacting with this breeze as well as the city proper 's uhi can seriously exacerbate air quality in late summer and early autumn the track of hurricanes or their remnants may cause flooding in downtown baltimore despite the city being far removed from the typical coastal storm surge areas extreme temperatures range from 7 f 22 c on february 9 1934 and february 10 1899 up to 108 f 42 c on july 22 2011 on average 100 f 38 c temperatures occur on 0 9 days

climate oklahoma is located in a humid subtropical region oklahoma lies in a transition zone between humid continental climate to the north semi arid climate to the west and humid subtropical climate in the central south and eastern portions of the state most of the state lies in an area known as tornado alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold dry air from canada warm to hot dry air from mexico and the southwestern u s and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico the interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather severe thunderstorms damaging thunderstorm winds large hail and tornadoes with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet earth an average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year one of the highest rates in the world because of oklahoma 's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time as an example on november 11 1911 the temperature at oklahoma city reached 83 f 28 c in the afternoon the record high for that date then an arctic cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state causing the temperature to crash 66 degrees down to 17 f 8 c at midnight the record low for that date thus both the record high and record low for november 11 were set on the same date this type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area such as the 1912 oklahoma tornado outbreak when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day the humid subtropical climate koppen cfa of central southern and eastern oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the gulf of mexico traveling westward the climate transitions progressively toward a semi arid zone koppen bsk in the high plains of the panhandle and other western areas from about lawton westward less frequently touched by southern moisture precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62 f 17 c and an annual rainfall of generally over 40 inches 1020 mm and up to 56 inches 1420 mm while areas of the higher elevation panhandle average 58 f 14 c with an annual rainfall under 17 inches 430 mm over almost all of oklahoma winter is the driest season average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in may the wettest month over most of the state with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity early june can still be wet but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during june and early july mid summer july and august represents a secondary dry season over much of oklahoma with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years severe drought is common in the hottest summers such as those of 1934 1954 1980 and 2011 all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and high temperatures well over 100 f 38 c average precipitation rises again from september to mid october representing a secondary wetter season then declines from late october through december all of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 f 38 c or below 0 f 18 c though below zero temperatures are rare in south central and southeastern oklahoma snowfall ranges from an average of less than 4 inches 10 cm in the south to just over 20 inches 51 cm on the border of colorado in the panhandle the state is home to the storm prediction center the national severe storms laboratory and the warning decision training branch all part of the national weather service and located in norman oklahoma 's highest recorded temperature of 120 f 49 c was recorded at tipton on june 27 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature of 31 f 35 c was recorded at nowata on february 10 2011 history evidence exists that native peoples traveled through oklahoma as early as the last ice age ancestors of the wichita and caddo lived in what is now oklahoma the panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region the westernmost center of the mississippian culture was spiro mounds in what is now spiro oklahoma which flourished between ad 850 and 1450 spaniard francisco v squez de coronado traveled through the state in 1541 but french explorers claimed the area in the 1700s and it remained under french rule until 1803 when all the french territory west of the mississippi river was purchased by the united states in the louisiana purchase the territory now known as oklahoma was first a part of the arkansas territory from 1819 until 1828 during the 19th century thousands of native americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across north america and transported to the area including and surrounding present day oklahoma the choctaw was the first of the five civilized tribes to be removed from the southeastern united states the phrase trail of tears originated from a description of the removal of the choctaw nation in 1831 although the term is usually used for the cherokee removal a total of 17000 cherokees and 2000 of their black slaves were deported the area already occupied by osage and quapaw tribes was called for the choctaw nation until revised native american and then later american policy redefined the boundaries to include other native americans by 1890 more than 30 native american nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within indian territory or indian country all five civilized tribes supported and signed treaties with the confederate military during the american civil war the cherokee nation had an internal civil war slavery in indian territory was not abolished until 1866 in the period between 1866 and 1899 cattle ranches in texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in indian territory in 1881 four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through indian territory increased presence of white settlers in indian territory prompted the united states government to establish the dawes act in 1887 which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families encouraging farming and private land ownership among native americans but expropriating land to the federal government in the process railroad companies took nearly half of indian held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase major land runs including the land run of 1889 were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time usually land was open to settlers on a first come first served basis those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border sooner leading to the term sooners which eventually became the state 's official nickname deliberations to make the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century when the curtis act continued the allotment of indian tribal land 20th and 21st centuries attempts to create an all indian state named oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all indian state named sequoyah failed but the sequoyah statehood convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the oklahoma statehood convention which took place two years later on november 16 1907 oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the union the new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth tulsa eventually became known as the oil capital of the world for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state 's early economy in 1927 oklahoman businessman cyrus avery known as the father of route 66 began the campaign to create u s route 66 using a stretch of highway from amarillo texas to tulsa oklahoma to form the original portion of highway 66 avery spearheaded the creation of the u s highway 66 association to oversee the planning of route 66 based in his hometown of tulsa oklahoma also has a rich african american history there were many black towns that thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from neighboring states especially kansas the politician edward p mccabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then indian territory he discussed with president theodore roosevelt the possibility of making oklahoma a majority black state by the early 20th century the greenwood neighborhood of tulsa was one of the most prosperous african american communities in the united states jim crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century but the blacks had created a thriving area social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the ku klux klan after 1915 the tulsa race riot broke out in 1921 with whites attacking blacks in one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in american history sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed 1 8 million in property damage and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people by the late 1920s the ku klux klan had declined to negligible influence within the state during the 1930s parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices extended drought and high winds known as the dust bowl areas of kansas texas new mexico and northwestern oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western united states over a twenty year period ending in 1950 the state saw its only historical decline in population dropping 6 9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the dust bowl soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams they built hundreds of reservoirs and man made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation by the 1960s oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes the most in the nation in 1995 oklahoma city was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic

considered a democratic stronghold being carried by the republican party in only two presidential elections 1920 and 1928 during this time it was also carried by every winning democratic candidate up to harry truman however oklahoma democrats were generally considered to be more conservative than democrats in other states after the 1948 election the state turned firmly republican although registered republicans were a minority in the state until 2015 starting in 1952 oklahoma has been carried by republican presidential candidates in all but one election 1964 this is not to say that

recorded inhabitants of the milwaukee area are the menominee fox mascouten sauk potawatomi ojibwe all algic algonquian peoples and ho chunk winnebago a siouan people native american tribes many of these people had lived around green bay before migrating to the milwaukee area around the time of european contact in the second half of the 18th century the indians at milwaukee played a role in all the major wars on the american continent during the french and indian war a group of ojibwas and pottawattamies from the far lake michigan i e the area from milwaukee to green bay joined the french canadian daniel li nard de beaujeu at the battle of the monongahela in the american revolutionary war the indians around milwaukee were some of the few indians who remained loyal to the american cause throughout the revolution after american independence the indians fought the united states in the northwest indian war as part of the council of three fires during the war of 1812 indians held a council in milwaukee in june 1812 which resulted in their decision to attack chicago this resulted in the battle of fort dearborn on august 15 1812 the only known armed conflict in the chicago area the war of 1812 did not end well for the indians and after the black hawk war in 1832 the indians in milwaukee signed their final treaty with the united states in chicago in 1833 this paved the way for american settlement milwaukee since european settlement europeans had arrived in the milwaukee area prior to the 1833 treaty of chicago french missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries alexis laframboise in 1785 coming from michilimackinac now in michigan settled a trading post therefore he is the first european descent resident of the milwaukee region the word milwaukee may come from the potawatomi language minwaking or ojibwe language ominowakiing gathering place by the water early explorers called the milwaukee river and surrounding lands various names melleorki milwacky mahn a waukie milwarck and milwaucki for many years printed records gave the name as milwaukie one story of milwaukee 's name says o ne day during the thirties of the last century 1800s a newspaper calmly changed the name to milwaukee and milwaukee it has remained until this day the spelling milwaukie lives on in milwaukie oregon named after the wisconsin city in 1847 before the current spelling was universally accepted milwaukee has three founding fathers solomon juneau byron kilbourn and george h walker solomon juneau was the first of the three to come to the area in 1818 he was not the first european settler alexis laframboise settled a trading post in 1785 but founded a town called juneau 's side or juneautown that began attracting more settlers in competition with juneau byron kilbourn established kilbourntown west of the milwaukee river and made sure the streets running toward the river did not join with those on the east side this accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in milwaukee today further kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed kilbourntown implying juneautown did not exist or the river 's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable the third prominent builder was george h walker he claimed land to the south of the milwaukee river along with juneautown where he built a log house in 1834 this area grew and became known as walker 's point the first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become milwaukee county and the city of milwaukee began in 1835 early that year it became known juneau and kilbourn intended to lay out competing town sites and by the years' end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales there were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year mostly from new england and other eastern states on september 17 1835 the first election was held in milwaukee the number of votes cast was 39 by 1840 the three towns had grown quite a bit along with their rivalries there were intense battles between the towns mainly juneautown and kilbourntown which culminated with the milwaukee bridge war of 1845 following the bridge war it was decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns so on january 31 1846 they combined to incorporate as the city of milwaukee and elected solomon juneau as milwaukee 's first mayor milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants mainly german made their way to wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s scholars classify german immigration to the united states in three major waves and wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three the first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from southwestern germany the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily northwestern germany while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from northeastern germany in the 1840s the number of people who left german speaking lands was 385434 in the 1850s it reached 976072 and an all time high of 1 4 million emigrated in the 1880s in 1890 the 2 78 million first generation german americans represented the second largest foreign born group in the united states of all those who left the german lands between 1835 and 1910 90 percent went to the united states most of them traveling to the mid atlantic states and the midwest by 1900 34 percent of milwaukee 's population was of german background the largest number of german immigrants to milwaukee came from prussia followed by bavaria saxony hanover and hesse darmstadt milwaukee gained its reputation for the most german of american cities not just from the large number of german immigrants it received but the sense of community which the immigrants established there most german immigrants came to wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland however immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in europe after 1848 hopes for a united germany had failed and revolutionary and radical germans known as the forty eighters turned their attention to the united states one of the most famous liberal revolutionaries of 1848 was carl schurz who explained why he came to milwaukee in 1854 it is true similar things cultural events and societies were done in other cities where the forty eighters sic had congregated but so far as i know nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'german athens of america' as milwaukee was called at the time schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies germans developed in milwaukee the pattern of german immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of german lifestyle and customs this resulted in german language organizations that encompassed all aspects of life for example singing societies and gymnastics clubs germans also made a lasting impact on the american school system kindergarten was created as a pre school for children and sports programs of all levels as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum these ideas were first introduced by radical democratic german groups such as the socialist turner societies known today as the american turners specifically in milwaukee the american turners established its own normal college for teachers of physical education and a german english academy milwaukee 's german element is still strongly present today the city celebrates its german culture by annually hosting a german fest in july and an oktoberfest in october milwaukee boasts a number of german restaurants as well as a traditional german beer hall even the german language is not lost as a german language immersion school is offered for children in grades k 5 germans were and still are an important component of life in wisconsin and milwaukee although the german presence in milwaukee after the civil war remained strong other groups made their way to the city foremost among these were polish immigrants the poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland mainly poverty and political oppression because milwaukee offered the polish immigrants an abundance of low paying entry level jobs it became one of the largest polish settlements in the usa for many residents milwaukee 's south side is synonymous with the polish community which settled here the group 's proud ethnicity maintained a high profile here for decades and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the families began to disperse to the southern suburbs by 1850 there were seventy five poles in milwaukee county and the us census shows they had a variety of occupations grocers blacksmiths tavernkeepers coopers butchers broommakers shoemakers draymen laborers and farmers three distinct polish communities evolved in milwaukee with the majority settling in the area south of greenfield avenue milwaukee county 's polish population of 30000 in 1890 rose to 100000 by 1915 poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity maintained through the catholic church a view of milwaukee 's south side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community st stanislaus catholic church and the surrounding neighborhood was the center of polish life in milwaukee as the polish community surrounding st stanislaus continued to grow mitchell street became known as the polish grand avenue as mitchell street grew denser the polish population started moving south to the lincoln village neighborhood home to the basilica of st josaphat and kosciuszko park other polish communities started on the east side of milwaukee and jones island a major commercial fishing center settled mostly by poles from the baltic sea milwaukee has the fifth largest polish population in the u s at 45467 ranking behind new york city 211203 chicago 165784 los angeles 60316 and philadelphia 52648 the city holds polish fest an annual celebration of polish culture and cuisine in addition to the germans and poles milwaukee received a large influx of other european immigrants from lithuania italy ireland france russia bohemia and sweden which included jews lutherans and catholics italian

producing a humid continental climate k ppen dfa with cold windy snowy winters and warm humid summers the warmest month of the year is july when the 24 hour average is 71 8 f 22 1 c while january is the coldest month with a 24 hour average of 22 3 f 5 4 c of the 50 largest cities in the united states milwaukee has the second coldest average annual temperature after minneapolis st paul because of milwaukee 's proximity to lake michigan a convection current forms around mid afternoon in light wind resulting in the so called lake breeze a smaller scale version of the more common sea breeze the lake breeze is most common between the months of march and july this onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually 5 to 15 miles 8 to 24 km with much warmer conditions persisting further inland residents refer to this phenomenon with the phrase cooler near the lake because milwaukee 's official climate site general mitchell international airport is only 3 miles 4 8 km from the lake seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the milwaukee metropolitan area as the sun sets the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze after a land breeze develops warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening the lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest west or northwest wind generally exceeds 15 mph 24 km h the lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months aside from the lake 's influence overnight lows in downtown milwaukee year round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the urban heat island effect onshore winds elevate daytime relative

diversify the economy by attracting health related high tech and other commercial interests no state tax for individuals or corporations as well as a lack of other forms of business related taxes have aided the success of these efforts with the strip expansion in the 1990s downtown las vegas which has maintained an old las vegas feel began to suffer however in recent years the city has made strides

burnside noted several obstacles that would be faced by the city if it were to become a professional sports market including the presence of legal sports betting scheduling conflicts with the large amount of residents who work nighttime and overnight shifts and that the casinos would be unlikely to give away tickets to such events as a promotion as they run contrary to a goal of encouraging

the eastern side of albuquerque and the rio grande flows through the city north to south albuquerque is also the home of the international balloon fiesta the world 's largest such gathering of hot air balloons from around the globe the event takes place during the first week of october etymology albuquerque was named in honor of francisco duke of alburquerque who was viceroy of new spain from 1653 to 1660 the growing village soon to become albuquerque was named by provincial governor francisco cuervo y vald s francisco 's title referred to the spanish town of alburquerque in the spanish province of badajoz near portugal the name has two theories of origin which denote either latin or arabic roots the first of which derived from the latin albus quercus meaning white oak this name was probably in reference to the prevalence of cork oaks in the region which have a white wood when the bark is removed alburquerque is still a center of the spanish cork industry and the town coat of arms features a white cork oak another theory suggests that it may come from the arabic abu al qurq which means father of the cork oak the first r in alburquerque was later dropped probably due to association with the prominent general alfonso de albuquerque whose family title among others and then name originated from the border spanish town but used a variant spelling in their name the change was also in part due to the fact that citizens found the original name difficult to pronounce western folklore offers a different explanation tracing the name albuquerque to the galician word albaricoque meaning apricot the apricot was brought to new mexico by spanish settlers possibly as early as 1743 as the story goes the settlement was established near an apricot tree and became known as la ciudad de albaricoque as frontiersmen were unable to correctly pronounce the galician word it became corrupted to albuquerque history early european settlers albuquerque was founded in 1706 as the spanish colonial outpost of villa de alburquerque present day albuquerque retains much of its historical spanish cultural heritage albuquerque was a farming community and strategically located military outpost along the camino real the town was also the sheep herding center of the west spain established a presidio military garrison in albuquerque in 1706 after 1821 mexico also had a military garrison there the town of alburquerque was built in the traditional spanish village pattern a central plaza surrounded by government buildings homes and a church this central plaza area has been preserved and is open to the public as a museum cultural area and center of commerce it is referred to as old town albuquerque or simply old town historically it was sometimes referred to as la placita little plaza in spanish on the north side of old town plaza is san felipe de neri church built in 1793 it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city after the american occupation of new mexico albuquerque had a federal garrison and quartermaster depot the post of albuquerque from 1846 to 1867 during the civil war albuquerque was occupied in february 1862 by confederate troops under general henry hopkins sibley who soon afterward advanced with his main body into northern new mexico during his retreat from union troops into texas he made a stand on april 8 1862 at albuquerque and fought the battle of albuquerque against a detachment of union soldiers commanded by colonel edward r s canby this daylong engagement at long range led to few casualties when the atchison topeka and santa fe railroad arrived in 1880 it bypassed the plaza locating the passenger depot and railyards about 2 miles 3 km east in what quickly became known as new albuquerque or new town many anglo merchants mountain men and settlers slowly filtered into albuquerque creating a major mercantile commercial center which is now downtown albuquerque due to a rising rate of violent crime gunman milt yarberry was appointed the town 's first marshal that year new albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885 with henry n jaffa its first mayor and it was incorporated as a city in 1891 old town remained a separate community until the 1920s when it was absorbed by the city of albuquerque old albuquerque high school the city 's first public high school was established in 1879 congregation albert a reform synagogue established in 1897 is the oldest continuing jewish organization in the city early 20th century by 1900 albuquerque boasted a population of 8000 inhabitants and all the modern amenities including an electric street railway connecting old town new town and the recently established university of new mexico campus on the east mesa in 1902 the famous alvarado hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot in 2002 the alvarado transportation center was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark the large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city 's transit department it also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses greyhound buses amtrak passenger trains and the rail runner commuter rail line new mexico 's dry climate brought many tuberculosis patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century and several sanitaria sprang up on the west mesa to serve them presbyterian hospital and st joseph hospital two of the largest hospitals in the southwest had their beginnings during this period influential new deal era governor clyde tingley and famed southwestern architect john gaw meem were among those brought to new mexico by tuberculosis decades of growth the first travelers on route 66 appeared in albuquerque in 1926 and before long dozens of motels restaurants and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them route 66 originally ran through the city on a north south alignment along fourth street but in 1937 it was realigned along central avenue a more direct east west route the intersection of fourth and central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades the majority of the surviving structures from the route 66 era are on central though there are also some on fourth signs between bernalillo and los lunas along the old route now have brown historical highway markers denoting it as pre 1937 route 66 the establishment of kirtland air force base in 1939 sandia base in the early 1940s and sandia national laboratories in 1949 would make albuquerque a key player of the atomic age meanwhile the city continued to expand outward onto the west mesa reaching a population of 201189 by 1960 in 1990 it was 384736 and in 2007 it was 518271 in june 2007 albuquerque was listed as the sixth fastest growing city in america by cnn and the united states census bureau in 1990 the census bureau reported albuquerque 's population as 34 5 hispanic and 58 3 non hispanic white albuquerque 's downtown entered the same phase and development decline urban renewal with continued decline and gentrification as nearly every city across the united states as albuquerque spread outward the downtown area fell into a decline many historic buildings were razed in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for new plazas high rises and parking lots as part of the city 's urban renewal phase as of 2010 only recently has downtown come to regain much of its urban character mainly through the construction of many new loft apartment buildings and the renovation of historic structures such as the kimo theater in the gentrification phase new millennium during the 21st century the albuquerque population has continued to grow rapidly the population of the city proper was estimated at 528497 in 2009 up from 448607 in the 2000 census during 2005 and 2006 the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events urban trends and issues the passage of the planned growth strategy in 2002 2004 was the community 's strongest effort to create a framework for a more balanced and sustainable approach to urban growth a critical finding of the study is that many of the 'disconnects' between the public 's preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or non existent implementation tools rather than by inadequate policies as contained in the city county comprehensive plan and other already adopted legislation urban sprawl is limited on three sides by the sandia pueblo to the north the isleta pueblo and kirtland air force base to the south and the sandia mountains to the east suburban growth continues at a strong pace to the west beyond petroglyph national monument once thought to be a natural boundary to sprawl development because of less costly land and lower taxes much of the growth in the metropolitan area is taking place outside of the city of albuquerque itself in rio rancho to the northwest the communities east of the mountains and the incorporated parts of valencia county population growth rates approach twice that of albuquerque the primary cities in valencia county are los lunas and belen both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions the mountain towns of tijeras edgewood and moriarty while close enough to albuquerque to be considered suburbs have experienced much less growth compared to rio rancho bernalillo los lunas and belen limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns the mid region council of governments mrcog which includes constituents from throughout the albuquerque area was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle rio grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations mrcog 's cornerstone project is currently the new mexico rail runner express in october 2013 the albuquerque journal reported albuquerque as the third best city to own an investment property geography according to the united states census bureau albuquerque has a total area of 189 5 square miles 490 9 km2 of which 187 7 square miles 486 2 km2 is land and 1 8 square miles 4 7 km2 or 0 96 is water albuquerque lies within the northern upper edges of the chihuahuan desert ecoregion based on long term patterns of climate associations of plants and wildlife and landforms including drainage patterns located in central new mexico the city also has noticeable influences from the adjacent colorado plateau semi desert arizona new mexico mountains and southwest plateaus and plains steppe ecoregions depending on where one is located its main geographic connection lies with southern new mexico while culturally albuquerque is a crossroads of most of new mexico albuquerque has one of the highest elevations of any major city in the united states though the effects of this are greatly tempered by its southwesterly continental position the elevation of the city ranges from 4900 feet 1490 m above sea level near the rio grande in the valley to over 6700 feet 1950 m in the foothill areas of sandia heights and glenwood hills at the airport the elevation is 5352 feet 1631 m above sea level the rio grande is classified like the nile as an exotic river because it flows through a desert the new mexico portion of the rio grande lies within the rio grande rift valley bordered by a system of faults including those that lifted up the adjacent sandia and manzano mountains while lowering the area where the life sustaining rio grande now flows geology albuquerque lies in the albuquerque basin a portion of the rio grande rift the sandia mountains are the predominant geographic feature visible in albuquerque sand a is spanish for watermelon and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset bright pink melon meat and green melon rind the pink is due to large exposures of granodiorite cliffs and the green is due to large swaths of conifer forests however robert julyan notes in the place names of new mexico the most likely explanation is the one believed by the sandia pueblo indians the spaniards when they encountered the pueblo in 1540 called it sandia because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons and the name sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo he also notes that the sandia pueblo indians call the mountain bien mur big mountain the sandia foothills on the west side of the mountains have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite mixed with areas of clay and caliche a calcium carbonate deposit common in the arid southwestern usa along with some exposed granite bedrock below the foothills the area usually called the northeast heights consists of a mix of clay and caliche soils overlaying a layer of decomposed granite resulting from long term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains this bajada is quite noticeable when driving into albuquerque from the north or south due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley sand hills are scattered along the i 25 corridor and directly above the rio grande valley forming the lower end of the heights the rio grande valley due to long term shifting of the actual river channel contains layers and areas of soils varying between caliche clay loam and even some sand it is the only part of albuquerque where the water table often lies close to the surface sometimes less than 10 feet 3 0 m the last significant area of albuquerque geologically is the west mesa this is the elevated land west of the rio grande including west bluff the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city the west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as blow sand along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt nearing the escarpment landscape climate albuquerque has a cold semi arid climate bsk in the k ppen climate classification albuquerque is in the northern tip of the chihuahuan desert near the edge of the colorado plateau the average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation and no month averages below freezing albuquerque 's climate is usually sunny and dry with an average of 3415 sunshine hours per year brilliant sunshine defines the region averaging 278 days a year periods of variably mid and high level cloudiness temper the sun at other times extended cloudiness is rare the city has four distinct seasons but the heat and cold are mild compared to the extremes that occur more commonly in other parts of the country winters are rather brief with december the coolest month averaging 36 3 f 2 4 c although low temperatures bottom out in january and the coldest temperature of the year is typically around 10 f 12 c there are 2 8 days where the high is at or below freezing spring is windy sometimes unsettled with some rain though spring is usually the driest part of the year in albuquerque march and april tend to see many days with the wind blowing at 20 to 30 mph 32 to 48 km h and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust in may the winds tend to subside the summer heat is relatively tolerable for most because of low humidity except for some days during the north american monsoon there are 2 7 days of 100 f 38 c highs annually mostly in june and july and rarely in august due in part to the monsoon an average 60 days see 90 f 32 c highs fall sees less rain than summer though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter albuquerque averages around 9 inches of snow per winter and experiences several accumulating snow events each season locations in the northeast heights and eastern foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region 's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains the city was one of several in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on december 28 30 2006 with locations in albuquerque receiving between 10 5 and 26 inches 27 and 66 cm of snow more recently a major winter storm in late february 2015 dropped up to a foot 30 cm of snow on most of the city the mountains and highlands beyond the city create a rain shadow effect due to the drying of air ascending the mountains the city usually receives very little rain or snow averaging 8 9 inches 216 mm of precipitation per year valley and west mesa areas farther from the mountains are drier averaging 6 8 inches of annual precipitation the sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture enhancing precipitation to about 10 17 inches annually traveling to the west north and east of albuquerque one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment one such area is still considered part of metro albuquerque commonly called the east mountain area it is covered in savannas or woodlands of low juniper and pi on trees reminiscent of the lower parts of the southern rocky mountains which do not actually contact albuquerque proper most rain occurs during the summer monsoon season also called a chubasco in mexico typically starting in early july and ending in mid september hydrology albuquerque 's drinking water presently comes from a combination of rio grande water river water diverted from the colorado river basin through the san juan chama project and a delicate aquifer that was once described as an underground lake superior the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority abcwua has developed a water resources management strategy which pursues conservation and the direct extraction of water from the rio grande for the development of a stable underground aquifer in the future the aquifer of the rio puerco is too saline to be cost effectively used for drinking purposes much of the rainwater that albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer it is diverted through a network of paved channels and arroyos and emptied into the rio grande of the 62780 acre feet 77440000 m3 per year of the water in the upper colorado river basin entitled to municipalities in new mexico by the upper colorado river basin compact albuquerque owns 48200 the water is delivered to the rio grande by the san juan chama project the project 's construction was initiated by legislation enacted by president john f kennedy in 1962 and completed in 1971 this diversion project transports water under the continental divide from navajo lake to lake heron on the rio chama a tributary of the rio grande in the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in texas these arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the abcwua 's drinking water supply project the abcwua 's drinking water supply project uses a system of adjustable height dams to skim water from the rio grande into sluices which lead to water treatment facilities for direct conversion to potable water some water is allowed to flow through central albuquerque mostly to protect the endangered rio grande silvery minnow treated effluent water is recycled into the rio grande to the south of the city the abcwua expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060 groundwater will constitute the remainder one of the policies of the abcwua 's strategy is the acquisition of additional river water quadrants albuquerque is geographically divided into four quadrants which are officially part of the mailing address they are ne northeast nw northwest se southeast and sw southwest the north south dividing line is central avenue the path that route 66 took through the city and the east west dividing line is the bnsf railway tracks northeast quadrant this quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s it abuts the base of the sandia mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods which are significantly higher in elevation and price range than the rest of the city running from central avenue and the railroad tracks to the sandia peak aerial tram this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population the university of new mexico the maxwell museum of anthropology nob hill the uptown area which includes two shopping malls coronado center and abq uptown hoffmantown journal center and balloon fiesta park are all located in this quadrant some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are located here including high desert tanoan sandia heights and north albuquerque acres parts of sandia heights and north albuquerque acres are outside the city limits proper a few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the cibola national forest just over the line into sandoval county northwest quadrant this quadrant contains historic old town albuquerque which dates back to the 18th century as well as the indian pueblo cultural center the area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to middle income neighborhoods northwest albuquerque includes the largest section

and borders corrales in the north valley a small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the petroglyphs known as the west mesa or westside consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions also extends into this quadrant the city proper is bordered on the north by the city of rio rancho southeast quadrant kirtland air force base sandia national

university stadium isotopes park the pit mesa del sol the pavilion albuquerque studios isleta resort casino national museum of nuclear science history new mexico veterans' memorial and talin market are all located in the southeast se quadrant the upscale neighborhood of four hills is located in the foothills of southeast albuquerque other neighborhoods include nob hill ridgecrest willow wood and volterra southwest quadrant traditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods the southwest quadrant comprises the south end of downtown albuquerque the barelas neighborhood the rapidly growing west side and the community of south valley new mexico often referred to as the south valley although the city limits of albuquerque do not include the south valley the quadrant extends through it all the way to the isleta indian reservation newer suburban subdivisions on the west mesa near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction some dating back as far as the 1940s this quadrant includes the old communities of atrisco los padillas huning castle kinney westgate westside alamosa mountainview and pajarito the bosque woodlands the national

supply of water has slowly disappeared causing tucson to seek alternative sources in 1881 water was pumped from a well on the banks of the santa cruz river and flowed by gravity through pipes into the

groundwater in an effort to conserve water tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of cap water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer additional study is scheduled to determine the amount of water that is lost through evaporation from the open areas especially during the summer the city of tucson already provides reclaimed water to its inhabitants but it is only used for applications such as irrigation dust control and industrial uses these resources have been in place for more than 27 years and deliver to over 900 locations to prevent further loss of groundwater tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts shifting away from its reliance on a series of tucson area wells in favor of conservation consumption based pricing for residential and commercial water use and new wells in the more sustainable avra valley aquifer northwest of the city an allocation from the central arizona project aqueduct cap which passes more than 300 mi 480 km across the desert from the colorado river has been incorporated into the city 's water supply annually providing over 20 million gallons of

california state university at fresno in 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of fresno city college one half mile north of the tower district this vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s after decades of neglect and suburban flight the neighborhood revival followed the re

the section of huntington boulevard between first street on the west to cedar avenue on the east is the home to many large stately homes the original development of this area began circa 1910 on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field the alta vista tract as the land would become known was mapped by william stranahan for the pacific improvement corporation and was officially platted in 1911 the tract 's boundaries were balch avenue on the south cedar avenue on the east the rear property line of platt avenue east of sixth street and platt avenue west of sixth street on the north and first street on the west the subdivision was annexed to the city in january 1912 in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community at the time of its admission to the city the alta

the necessary municipal improvements including water service and began marketing the property with fervor a mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes this rapid development was no doubt hastened

francisco bay area and the san diego metropolitan area and is the 27th largest in the united states in 2002 the civil rights project at harvard university conducted for time magazine named sacramento america 's most diverse city sacramento became a city through the efforts of the swiss immigrant john sutter sr his son john augustus sutter jr and james w marshall sacramento grew quickly thanks to the protection of sutter 's fort which was established by sutter in 1839 during the california gold rush sacramento was a major distribution point a commercial and agricultural center and a terminus for wagon trains stagecoaches riverboats the telegraph the pony express and the first transcontinental railroad the city was named after the sacramento river which forms its western border the river was named by spanish cavalry officer gabriel moraga for the sant simo sacramento blessed sacrament referring to the catholic eucharist california state university sacramento more commonly known as sacramento state or sac state is the largest university in the city and one of 23 campuses in the california state university system university of the pacific 's sacramento campus is a private

renowned research hospital is located in the city of sacramento history indigenous culture nisenan southern maidu and plains miwok native americans had lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years unlike the settlers who would eventually make sacramento their home these native americans left little evidence of their existence traditionally their diet was dominated by acorns taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region and by fruits bulbs seeds and roots gathered throughout the year spanish exploration in 1808 the spanish explorer gabriel moraga discovered and named the sacramento valley and the sacramento river a spanish writer with the moraga expedition wrote canopies of oaks and cottonwoods many festooned with grapevines overhung both sides of the blue current birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths the air was like champagne and the spaniards drank deep of it drank in the beauty around them es como el sagrado sacramento it 's like the blessed sacrament the valley and the river were then christened after the most holy sacrament of the body and blood of christ referring to the catholic sacrament of the eucharist mexican period sutter 's fort and new helvetia john sutter first arrived on august 13 1839 at the divergence of the american and sacramento rivers with a mexican land grant of 50000 acres the next year he and his party established sutter 's fort a massive adobe structure with walls eighteen feet high and three feet thick representing mexico sutter called his colony new helvetia a swiss inspired name and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement soon the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west within just a few short years john sutter had become a grand success owning a ten acre orchard and a herd of thirteen thousand cattle fort sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley in 1847 sutter hired james marshall to build a sawmill so that he could continue to expand his empire from pioneers to gold fever sutter received 2000 fruit trees in 1847 which started the agriculture industry in the sacramento valley in 1848 when gold was discovered by james w marshall at sutter 's mill in coloma located some 50 miles 80 5 km northeast of the fort a large number of gold seekers came to the area increasing the population john sutter jr then planned the city of sacramento 2 miles south of new helvetia in association with sam brannan against the wishes of his father naming the city after the sacramento river for commercial reasons he hired topographical engineer william h warner to draft the official layout of the city which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets today 's grid from c st to broadway and from front st to alhambra blvd however a bitterness grew between the elder sutter and his son as sacramento became an overnight commercial success sutter 's fort mill and the town of sutterville all founded by john sutter sr would eventually fail the citizens of sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849 which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850 sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in california incorporated on february 27 1850 during the early 1850s the sacramento valley was devastated by floods fires and cholera epidemics despite this because of its position just downstream from the mother lode in the sierra nevada the new city grew quickly reaching a population of 10000 remnants of downtown sacramento 's chinatown throughout the early 1840s and 1850s china was at war with great britain and france in the first and second opium wars the wars along with endemic poverty in china helped drive many chinese immigrants to america many first came to san francisco which was then the largest city in california which was known as dai fow the big city and some came eventually to sacramento then the second largest city in california which is known as yee fow second city many of these immigrants came in hope of a better life as well as the possibility of finding gold in the foothills east of sacramento sacramento 's chinatown was located on i street from second to sixth streets at the time this area of i street was considered a health hazard because lying within a levee zone it was lower than other parts of the city which were situated on higher land throughout sacramento 's chinatown history there were fires acts of discrimination and prejudicial legislation such as the chinese exclusion act that was not repealed until 1943 the mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the chinese working class ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the chinese to move out newspapers such as the sacramento union wrote stories at the time that portrayed the chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the chinese away as the years passed a railroad was created over parts of the chinatown and further politics and laws would make it even harder for chinese workers to sustain a living in sacramento while the east side of the country fought for higher wages and fewer working hours many cities in the western united states wanted the chinese out because of the belief that they were stealing jobs from the white working class the chinese remained resilient despite these efforts they built their buildings out of bricks just as the building guidelines were established they helped build part of the railroads that span the city as well as made a great contribution to the transcontinental railroad that spans the united states they also helped build the levees within sacramento and its surrounding cities as a result the chinese are a well recognized part of sacramento 's history and heritage while most of sacramento 's chinatown has now been razed a small chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to

location sacramento quickly prospered and became the western end of the pony express later it became a terminus of the first transcontinental railroad which began construction in sacramento in 1863 and was financed by the big four mark hopkins charles crocker collis p huntington and leland stanford in 1850 and again in 1861 sacramento citizens were faced with a completely flooded town after the devastating 1850 flood sacramento experienced a cholera epidemic and a flu epidemic which crippled the town for several years in 1861 governor leland stanford who was inaugurated in early january 1861 had to attend his inauguration in a rowboat which was not too far from his house in town on n street the flood waters were so bad the legend says that when he returned to his house he had to enter into it through the second floor window from 1862 until the mid 1870s sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets and filling the resulting street walls with dirt thus the previous first floors of buildings became the basements with open space between the street and the building previously the sidewalk now at the basement level most property owners used screw jacks to raise their buildings to the new grade the sidewalks were covered initially by wooden sidewalks then brick barrel vaults and eventually replaced by concrete sidewalks over the years many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development however it is still possible to view portions of the sacramento underground the same rivers that earlier brought death and destruction began to provide increasing levels of transportation and commerce both the american and especially sacramento rivers would be key elements in the economic success of the city in fact sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers and public works projects were funded though taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic sacramento rail yards now both rivers are used extensively for recreation the american river is a 5 mph 8 km h waterway for all power boats including jet ski and similar

coastal southern california for over 10000 years and several successive cultures have inhabited the present day area of long beach by the 16th century arrival of spanish explorers the dominant group were the tongva people they had at least three major settlements within the present day city tevaaxa'anga was an inland settlement near the los angeles river while ahwaanga and povuu'nga were coastal villages along with other tongva villages they were forced to relocate in the mid 19th century due to missionization political change and a drastic drop in population from exposure to european diseases in 1784 the spanish empire 's king carlos iii granted rancho los nietos to spanish soldier manuel nieto the rancho los cerritos and rancho los alamitos were divided from this territory the boundary between the two ranchos ran through the center of signal hill on a southwest to northeast diagonal a portion of western long beach was originally part of the rancho san pedro its boundaries were in dispute for years due to flooding changing the los angeles river boundary between the ranchos of juan jose dominguez and manuel nieto in 1843 jonathan temple bought rancho los cerritos having arrived in california in 1827 from new england he built what is now known as the los cerritos ranch house a still standing adobe which is a national historic landmark temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered becoming the wealthiest man in los angeles county both temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the mexican american war on an island in the san pedro bay mormon pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony as part of brigham young 's plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the pacific to salt lake in 1866 temple sold rancho los cerritos for 20000 to the northern california sheep raising firm of flint bixby co which consisted of brothers thomas and benjamin flint and their cousin lewellyn bixby two years previous flint bixby co had also purchased along with northern california associate james irvine three ranchos which would later become the city that bears irvine 's name to manage rancho los cerritos the company selected lewellyn 's brother jotham bixby the father of long beach three years later bixby bought into the property and would later form the bixby land company in the 1870s as many as 30000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade in 1880 bixby sold 4000 acres 16 km2 of the rancho los cerritos to william e willmore who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community willmore city he failed and was bought out by a los angeles syndicate that called itself the long beach land and water company they changed the name of the community to long beach at that time the city of long beach was officially incorporated in 1897 another bixby cousin john w bixby was influential in the city after first working for his cousins at los cerritos j w bixby leased land at rancho los alamitos he put together a group banker i w hellman lewellyn and jotham bixby and him to purchase the rancho in addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the alamitos which under abel stearns in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the us j w bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city 's picturesque bluffs under the name alamitos land company j w bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city this area would include belmont heights belmont shore and naples it soon became a thriving community of its own j w bixby died in 1888 of apparent appendicitis the rancho los alamitos property was split up with hellman getting the southern third jotham and lewellyn the northern third and j w bixby 's widow and heirs keeping the central third the alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity but at first it was primarily run by lewellyn and jotham bixby although i w hellman who had the largest single share had a significant veto power an influence made even stronger as the j w bixby heirs began to side with hellman more and more when jotham bixby died in 1916 the remaining 3500 acres 14 km2 of rancho los cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of bixby knolls california heights north long beach and part of the city of signal hill the town grew as a seaside resort with light agricultural uses the pike was the most famous beachside amusement zone on the west coast from 1902 until 1969 it offered bathers food games and rides such at the sky wheel dual ferris wheel and cyclone racer roller coaster gradually the oil industry navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city in the 1950s it was referred to as iowa by the sea due to a large influx of people from that and other midwestern states huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in long beach until the 1960s oil was discovered in 1921 on signal hill which split off as a separate incorporated city shortly afterward the discovery of the long beach oil field brought in by the gusher at the alamitos no 1 well made long beach a major oil producer in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world in 1932 the even larger wilmington oil field fourth largest in the united states and which is mostly in long beach was developed contributing to the city 's fame in the 1930s as an oil town the m6 4 1933 long beach earthquake caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas killing a total of 120 people most of the damage occurred

ford model a production of ford vehicles continued after the war until 1960 when the plant was closed due to a fire and january 1991 when the factory was demolished partially due to air quality remediation efforts ford had earlier opened a factory in los angeles at the location of 12th street and olive with a later factory built at east seventh street and santa fe avenue after 1914 the city was the site of the los angeles air raid of 1942 during world war ii when observers for the army air corps reported shells being fired from the sea anti aircraft batteries fired into the night sky although no planes were ever sighted before the war long beach had a sizable japanese american population who worked in the fish canneries on terminal island and owned small truck produce farms in the area due to exaggerated fears on the coast and racial prejudice state officials persuaded the national government to remove japanese nationals and japanese americans for internment in 1942 to inland facilities most did not return to the city after their release from the camps due to this and other factors japanese americans now make up less than 1 of the population of long beach but the japanese community center and a japanese buddhist church survive the japanese american cultural center is located over the gerald desmond bridge and the vincent thomas bridge in san pedro douglas aircraft

long beach completely surrounds the city of signal hill neighborhoods long beach is composed of many different neighborhoods some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares while others are named for nearby parks schools or city features climate long beach depending on the reporting location has a mediterranean climate with strong semi arid climate characteristics days in long beach are mostly sunny as in southern california in general temperatures recorded at the weather station at the long beach airport 4 0 miles 6 4 km inland from the ocean range more greatly than those along the immediate coast during the summer months low clouds and fog occur frequently developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings this fog usually clears by the afternoon and a westerly sea breeze often develops keeping temperatures mild heat and humidity rarely coincide making heat waves more tolerable than they would be otherwise long beach 's geographic location directly east of the palos verdes peninsula paired with its mostly south facing coastline results in the city having significantly different weather patterns than coastal communities to the north and south the 1200 ft palos verdes hills block west to east airflow and with it a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other coastal cities such as manhattan beach santa monica and newport beach as in most locations in southern california most rainfall occurs during the winter months storms can bring heavy rainfall environment pollution long beach suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the entire united states most of the city is in proximity to the twin ports of los angeles and long beach and the prevailing westerly to west south westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports' air pollution directly into long beach before dispersing it northward then eastward heavy pollution sources at the ports include the ships themselves which burn high sulfur high soot producing bunker fuel to maintain internal electrical power while docked as well as heavy diesel pollution from drayage trucks at the ports and short haul tractor trailer trucks ferrying cargo from the ports to inland warehousing rail yards and shipping centers long term average levels of toxic air pollutants and the corresponding carcinogenic risk they create can be two to three times higher in and around long beach and in downwind areas to the east than in other parts of the los angeles metropolitan area such as the westside san fernando valley or san gabriel valley while overall regional pollution in the los angeles metropolitan area has declined in the last decade pollution levels remain dangerously high in much of long beach due to the port pollution with diesel exhaust from ships trains and trucks as the largest sources additionally the long beach area is directly downwind of several of the south bay oil refineries any refinery process or upset that results in the atmospheric release of refinery by products commonly sulfur dioxide will usually impact air in long beach due to the west south westerly prevailing wind similarly the water quality in the long beach portion of san pedro bay which is enclosed by the federal breakwater commonly ranks among the poorest on the entire west coast during rainy periods many long beach beaches average a d or f grade on beach water quality during wet periods in the beach report card published by heal the bay however during dry periods the water often attains a ratings in the same reports the los angeles river discharges directly into the long beach side of san pedro bay and conveys a large portion of all the urban runoff from the entire los angeles metropolitan area directly into the harbor water this runoff contains most of the debris garbage chemical pollutants and biological pathogens that are washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains because the breakwater prevents normal tidal flushing and wave action these pollutants build up in the harbor the water enclosed by the breakwater along most of the city 's beaches can be subject to red tides due to this stagnation as well because of these factors the water in long beach is unsafe for swimming on a few days or weeks each year ecology the area that is now long beach historically included several ecological communities with coastal scrub dominating a handful of the native plants of the region can still be found in the city these include california buckwheat eriogonum fasciculatum california sagebrush artemisia californica and california poppy eschscholzia californica some stands of coast live oak quercus agrifolia still remain in the el dorado nature center california fan palm washingtonia filifera a plant that is native further inland was introduced to the city as a garden ornamental and is now naturalized some indigenous species of birds mammals and other wildlife have adapted to development since the arrival of europeans many alien species have become naturalized in the area introduced plants include yellow mustard eucalyptus wild radish and tumbleweed such plants now far outnumber the indigenous plants and spread rapidly in the city 's vacant lots and oil fields the city and its residents have initiatives underway to preserve and reclaim part of its ecological heritage the riverlink project has begun to revegetate the long beach stretch of the los angeles river with indigenous plants part of the remaining pacific electric right of way was cleared of nonnatives planted with indigenous plants and made accessible with foot and bike paths this community open space is now known as the long beach greenbelt and is the focus of continuing efforts in restoration and community education the el dorado nature center has changed its original hands off approach and has begun to actively introduce indigenous species the los cerritos wetlands study group state government agencies and grassroots groups are collaborating on a plan to preserve long beach 's last remaining wetlands long beach is the first city in california to join the 'ecozone' program intended to measurably improve environmental conditions through public private partnerships such projects seek to reduce pollution restore native habitat and provide green areas for the city 's residents to enjoy other places in long beach to see natural areas include

united states its capital is topeka and its largest city is wichita kansas is named after the kansa native american tribe which inhabited the area the tribe 's name natively kk ze is often said to mean people of the wind or people of the south wind although this was probably not the term 's original meaning for thousands of years what is now kansas was home to numerous and diverse native american tribes tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys tribes in the western part of the state were semi nomadic and hunted large herds of bison kansas was first settled by european americans in 1812 in what is the now bonner springs kansas but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue when it was officially opened to settlement by the u s government in 1854 abolitionist free staters from new england and pro slavery settlers from neighboring missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether kansas would become a free state or a slave state thus the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided and was known as bleeding kansas the abolitionists eventually prevailed and on january 29 1861 kansas entered the union as a free state after the civil war the population of kansas grew rapidly when waves of immigrants turned the prairie into farmland today kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states producing high yields of wheat corn sorghum and soybeans kansas with its 213000 km2 is the 15th most extensive and with its about 2 9 million people the 34th most populous of the 50 united states residents of kansas are called kansans officially mount sunflower is kansas 's highest point at 1232 m history for a millennia

modern kansas was secured by the united states as part of the louisiana purchase southwest kansas however was still a part of spain mexico and the republic of texas until the conclusion of the mexican american war in 1848 from 1812 to 1821 kansas was part of the missouri territory the santa fe trail traversed kansas from 1821 to 1880 transporting manufactured goods from missouri and silver and furs from santa fe new mexico wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today in 1827 fort leavenworth became the first permanent settlement of white americans in the future state the kansas nebraska act became law on may 30 1854 establishing the u s territories of nebraska and kansas and opening the area to broader settlement by whites kansas territory stretched all the way to the continental divide and included the sites of present day denver colorado springs and pueblo missouri and arkansas sent settlers into kansas all along its eastern border these settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery the secondary settlement of americans in kansas territory were abolitionists from massachusetts and other free staters who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring missouri directly presaging the american civil war these forces collided entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of bleeding kansas kansas was admitted to the united states as a free state on january 29 1861 making it the 34th state to enter the union by that time the violence in kansas had largely subsided but during the civil war on august 21 1863 william quantrill led several hundred men on a raid into lawrence destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people he was roundly condemned by both the conventional confederate military and the partisan rangers commissioned by the missouri legislature his application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre war criminal record after the civil war many veterans constructed homesteads in kansas many african americans also looked to kansas as the land of john brown and led by freedmen like benjamin pap singleton began establishing black colonies in the state

it has humid continental semi arid steppe and humid subtropical the eastern two thirds of the state especially the northeastern portion has a humid continental climate with cool to cold winters and hot often humid summers most of the precipitation falls in the summer and spring the western third of the state from roughly the u s route 83 corridor westward has a semiarid steppe climate summers

chinook winds in the winter can warm western kansas all the way into the 80 f 27 c range the far south central and southeastern reaches of the state including wichita have a humid subtropical climate with hot humid summers milder winters and more precipitation than elsewhere in kansas some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state with droughts and changeable weather between

route 50 reach 100 f 38 c or above on most days of june july and august high humidity added to the high temperatures sends the heat index into life threatening territory especially in wichita hutchinson salina russell hays and great bend temperatures are often higher in dodge city garden city and liberal but the heat index in those locations is usually lower than the actual air temperature although temperatures of 100 degrees or higher are not as common in areas east of us 81 higher humidity and the urban heat island effect lead most summer days to heat indices between 107 f 42 c and 114 f 46 c in topeka lawrence and the kansas city metropolitan area during the summer nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state especially in the aforementioned large cities

portuguese and spanish for table is the american english term for tableland an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs it takes its name from its characteristic table top shape it may also be called a table hill table topped hill or table mountain it is larger than a butte which it otherwise resembles closely it is a characteristic landform of arid environments particularly the western and southwestern united states in badlands and mountainous regions ranging from washington and california to the dakotas wyoming utah and texas examples are also found in many other nations including spain sardinia north and south africa arabia india and australia grand mesa is a large mesa located in western colorado in the southwest united states cerro negro is a mesa in argentina the term mesa is used throughout the united states to describe a flat topped mountain or hill formation mesas form by weathering and erosion of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by tectonic activity variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and erosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings this process is called differential erosion the most resistant rock types include sandstone conglomerate quartzite basalt chert limestone lava flows and sills lava flows and sills in particular are very resistant to weathering and erosion and often form the flat top or caprock of a mesa the less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of shale a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily the differences in strength of various rock layers is what gives mesas their distinctive shape less resistant rocks are eroded away on the surface into valleys where they collect water drainage from the surrounding area while the more resistant layers are left standing out a large area of very resistant rock such as a sill may shield the layers below it from erosion while the softer rock surrounding it is eroded into valleys thus forming a caprock differences in rock type also reflect on the sides of a mesa as instead of smooth slopes the sides are broken into a staircase pattern called cliff and bench topography the more resistant layers form the cliffs or stairsteps while the less resistant layers form gentle slopes or benches between the cliffs cliffs retreat and are eventually cut off from the main cliff or plateau by basal sapping when the cliff edge does not retreat uniformly but instead is indented by headward eroding streams a section can be cut off from the main cliff forming a mesa basal sapping occurs as water flowing around the rock layers of the mesa erodes the underlying soft shale layers either as surface runoff from the mesa top or from groundwater moving through permeable overlying layers which leads to slumping and flowage of the shale as the underlying shale erodes away it can no longer support the overlying cliff layers which collapse and retreat when the caprock has caved away to the point where only a little remains it is known as a butte on mars a transitional zone on mars known as the fretted terrain lies between highly cratered highlands and less cratered lowlands the younger lowland exhibits steep walled mesas and knobs the mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands they are thought to form from ice facilitated mass wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources the mesas and knobs decrease in size with increasing distance from the highland escarpment the relief of the mesas range from nearly 2 km to 100m depending on the distance they are from the escarpment see also references virginia beach is an independent

peachtree a creek village located where peachtree creek flows into the chattahoochee river was the closest indian settlement to what is now atlanta as part of the systematic removal of native americans from northern georgia from 1802 to 1825 the creek ceded the area in 1821 and white settlers arrived the following year in 1836 the georgia general assembly voted to build the western and atlantic railroad in order to provide a link between the port of savannah and the midwest the initial route was to run southward from chattanooga to a terminus east of the chattahoochee river which would then be linked to savannah after engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus the zero milepost was driven into the ground in what is now five points a year later the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement first known as terminus and later as thrasherville after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area by 1842 the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed marthasville to honor the governor 's daughter j edgar thomson chief engineer of the georgia railroad suggested the town be renamed atlantica pacifica which was shortened to atlanta the residents approved and the town was incorporated as atlanta on december 29 1847 by 1860 atlanta 's population had grown to 9554 during the civil war the nexus of multiple railroads in atlanta made the city a hub for the distribution of military supplies in 1864 following the capture of chattanooga the union army moved southward and began its invasion of north georgia

suburbs the city 's skyline emerged with the construction of the equitable flatiron empire and candler buildings and sweet auburn emerged as a center of black commerce however the period was also

loew 's grand theatre but oscar winner hattie mcdaniel an african american was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws and policies atlanta played a vital role in the allied effort during world war ii due the city 's war related manufacturing companies railroad network and military bases leading to rapid growth in the city 's population and economy in the 1950s the city 's newly constructed freeway system allowed middle class atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs as a result the city began to make up an ever smaller proportion of the metropolitan area 's population during the 1960s atlanta was a major organizing center of the civil rights movement with dr martin luther king jr ralph david abernathy and students from atlanta 's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement 's leadership while minimal compared to other cities atlanta was not completely free of racial strife in 1961 the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in cascade heights countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster atlanta as the city too busy to hate desegregation of the public sphere came in stages with public transportation desegregated by 1959 the restaurant at rich 's department store by 1961 movie theaters by 1963 and public schools by 1973 in 1960 whites comprised 61 7 of the city 's population

tenure atlanta 's airport was modernized solidifying the city 's role as a transportation center the opening of the georgia world congress center in 1976 heralded atlanta 's rise as a convention city construction of the city 's subway system began in 1975 with rail service commencing in 1979 however despite these improvements atlanta lost over 100000 residents between 1970 and 1990 over 20 of its population in 1990 atlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 summer olympic games following the announcement the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve atlanta 's parks sporting venues and transportation infrastructure while the games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies as well as the centennial olympic park bombing they were a watershed event in atlanta 's history initiating a fundamental transformation of the city in the decade that followed during the 2000s atlanta underwent a profound transformation demographically physically and culturally suburbanization a booming economy and new migrants decreased the city 's black percentage from a high of 67 in 1990 to 54 in 2010 from 2000 to 2010 atlanta gained 22763 white residents 5142 asian residents and 3095 hispanic residents while the city 's black population decreased by 31678 much of the city 's demographic change during the decade was driven by young college educated professionals from 2000 to 2009 the three mile radius surrounding downtown atlanta gained 9722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four year degree an increase of 61 between the mid 1990s and 2010 stimulated by funding from the hope vi program atlanta demolished nearly all of its public housing a total of 17000 units and about 10 of all housing units in the city in 2005 the 2 8 billion beltline project was adopted with the stated goals of converting a disused 22 mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art filled multi use trail and increasing the city 's park space by 40 lastly atlanta 's cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s the high museum of art doubled in size the alliance theatre won a tony award and numerous art galleries were established on the once industrial westside geography atlanta encompasses 134 0 square miles 347 1 km2 of which 133 2 square miles 344 9 km2 is land and 0 85 square miles 2 2 km2 is water the city is

the gulf of mexico atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the chattahoochee river which is part of the acf river basin located at the far northwestern edge of the city much of the river 's natural habitat is preserved in part by the chattahoochee river national recreation area cityscape most of atlanta was burned during the civil war depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture yet architecturally the city had never been particularly southern because atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a patrician southern seaport like savannah or charleston many of the city 's landmarks could have easily been erected in the northeast or midwest during the cold war era atlanta embraced global modernist trends especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture examples of modernist architecture include the 1196240sq ft westin peachtree plaza 1976 georgia pacific tower 1982 the state of georgia building 1966 and the atlanta marriott marquis 1985 in the latter half of the 1980s atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape many of atlanta 's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns such as the 1187676 sq ftone atlantic center 1987 191 peachtree tower 1991 and the four seasons hotel atlanta 1992 also completed during the era is atlanta 's tallest skyscraper the bank of america plaza 1992 which at 1023 feet 312 m is the 61st tallest building in the world and the 9th tallest building in the united states the bank of america plaza is the tallest building outside of new york city and chicago and was the last building built in the united states to be in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until one world trade center was completed externally in may 2013 the city 's embrace of modern architecture however translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks including the equitable building 1892 1971 terminal station 1905 1972 and the carnegie library 1902 1977 the fox theatre 1929 atlanta 's cultural icon would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid 1970s atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods the city contains three major high rise districts which form a north south axis along peachtree downtown midtown and buckhead surrounding these high density districts are leafy low density neighborhoods most of which

and many of its tourist attractions midtown atlanta is the city 's second largest business district containing the offices of many of the region 's law firms midtown is also known for its art institutions cultural attractions institutions of higher education and dense form buckhead the city 's uptown district is eight miles 13 km north of downtown and the city 's third largest business district the district is marked by an urbanized core along peachtree road surrounded by suburban single family neighborhoods situated among dense forests and rolling hills surrounding atlanta 's three high rise districts are the city 's low and medium density neighborhoods where the craftsman bungalow single family home is dominant the eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the 1890s 1930s as havens for the upper middle class these neighborhoods many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded architecturally distinct residential streets include the victorian inman park bohemian east atlanta and eclectic old fourth ward on the westside former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing retail space and art galleries transforming the once industrial west midtown into a model neighborhood for smart growth historic rehabilitation and infill construction in southwest atlanta neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs including the historic west end while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout including collier heights and cascade heights home to much of the city 's affluent african american population northwest atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of marietta boulevard and to the north of martin luther king jr drive including those neighborhoods remote to downtown such as riverside bolton and whittier mill which is one of atlanta 's designated landmark historical neighborhoods vine city though technically northwest adjoins the city 's downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives gentrification of the city 's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary atlanta the gentrification of atlanta has its origins in the 1970s after many of atlanta 's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major american cities in the mid 20th century when neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through city 's the east side in 1975 the area became the starting point for atlanta 's gentrification after atlanta was awarded the olympic games in 1990 gentrification expanded into other parts of the city stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games gentrification was also aided by the atlanta housing authority 's eradication of the city 's public housing climate under the k ppen classification atlanta has a humid subtropical climate cfa

range from 63 6 f 18 c in june to 67 8 f 20 c in july typical of the southeastern u s atlanta receives abundant rainfall that is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year though spring and

border between the coastal southern and southern appalachian dialects because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region attracting migrants from other areas of the country by 2003

atlanta the worst housing market in the country nevertheless in august 2013 atlanta appeared on forbes magazine 's list of the best places for business and careers culture atlanta while located in the south has a culture that is no longer strictly southern this is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the u s in addition to many recent immigrants to the u s who have made the metropolitan area their home establishing atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly multi cultural metropolitan area thus although traditional southern culture is part of atlanta 's cultural fabric it is mostly the backdrop to one of the nation 's most cosmopolitan cities this unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of midtown the quirky neighborhoods on the city 's eastside and the multi ethnic enclaves found along buford highway arts and theater atlanta is one of few united states cities with permanent professional resident companies in all major

southwestern sections of the loop and the directional signage on the remaining i 440 portion was changed from inner outer to east west the route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the inner outer designations especially with raleigh 's new outer beltline as i 540 has become known i 540 nc 540 is currently under development it is a partially completed outer beltway that

agencies throughout the raleigh durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed rail transit service for the region from 1995 the cornerstone of triangle transit 's long term plan was a 28 mile rail corridor from northeast raleigh through downtown raleigh cary and research triangle park to durham using dmu technology there were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to chapel hill with light rail technology however in 2006 triangle transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the federal transit administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections the region 's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of triangle transit 's problems the special transit advisory commission stac retained many of the provisions of triangle transit 's original plan but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half cent sales tax to fund the project greyhound lines provides an inter city bus service to durham charlotte richmond washington d c atlanta and other

to the west and biscayne bay to the east which also extends from florida bay north to lake okeechobee the elevation of the area never rises above 40 ft 12 m and averages at around 6 ft 1 8 m above mean sea level in most neighborhoods especially near the coast the highest undulations are found along the coastal miami rock ridge whose substrate underlies most of the eastern miami metropolitan region the main portion of the city lies on the shores of biscayne bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created barrier islands the largest of which contains miami beach and south beach the gulf stream a warm ocean current runs northward just 15 miles 24 km off the coast allowing the city 's climate to stay warm and mild all year geology the surface bedrock under the miami area is called miami oolite or miami limestone this bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil and is no more than 50 feet 15 m thick miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or ice ages beginning some 130000 years ago the sangamonian stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet 8 m above the current level all of southern florida was covered by a shallow sea several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged florida plateau stretching from the present miami area to what is now the dry tortugas the area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon and the miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans starting about 100000 years ago the wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels exposing the floor of the lagoon by 15000 years ago the sea level had dropped to 300 to 350 feet 90 to 110 m below the contemporary level the sea level rose quickly after that stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago leaving the mainland of south florida just above sea level beneath the plain lies the biscayne aquifer a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern palm beach county to florida bay with its highest point peaking around the cities of miami springs and hialeah most of the miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer as a result of the aquifer it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft 5 to 6 m beneath the city without hitting water which impedes underground construction though some underground parking garages exist for this reason the mass transit systems in and around miami are elevated or at grade most of the western fringes of the city

of 16 though the beginning point of this system is at sw 8th st one half mile south of flagler zeroth street thus major streets are at 8th st 16 24th st coral way 16 40th st bird 16 56th miller 16

outside the city the haitian revolution ended in 1804 and established the second republic in the western hemisphere and the first republic led by black people it had occurred over several years in what was then the french colony of saint domingue thousands of refugees from the revolution both whites and free people of color affranchis or gens de couleur libres arrived in new orleans often bringing african slaves with them while governor claiborne and other officials wanted to keep out additional free black men the french creoles wanted to increase the french speaking population as more refugees were allowed in louisiana haitian migr s who had first gone to cuba also arrived many of the white francophones had been deported by officials in cuba in retaliation for bonapartist schemes in spain nearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in new orleans the 1809 migration brought 2731 whites 3102 free persons of african descent and 3226 enslaved persons of african descent doubling the city 's population the city became 63 percent black in population a greater proportion than charleston south carolina 's 53 percent during the final campaign of the war of 1812 the british sent a

us government did not ratify it until february 16 1815 the fighting in louisiana had begun in december 1814 and did not end until late january after the americans held off the british navy during a ten day siege of fort st philip the royal navy went on to capture fort bowyer near mobile before the commanders received news of the peace treaty as a principal port new orleans played a major role during the antebellum era in the atlantic slave trade its port also handled huge quantities of commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries which were warehoused and transferred in new orleans to smaller vessels and distributed the length and breadth of the vast mississippi river watershed the river in front of the city was filled with steamboats flatboats and sailing ships despite its role in the slave trade new orleans at the same time had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons of color in the nation who were often educated and middle class property owners dwarfing in population the other cities in the antebellum south new orleans had the largest slave market in the domestic slave trade which expanded after the united states' ending of the international trade in 1808 two thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the deep south arrived via the forced migration of the domestic slave trade the money generated by the sale of slaves in the upper south has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy the slaves represented half a billion dollars in property an ancillary economy grew up around the trade in slaves for transportation housing and clothing fees etc estimated at 13 5 percent of the price per person all of this amounted to tens of billions of dollars 2005 dollars adjusted for inflation during the antebellum period with new orleans as a prime beneficiary according to the historian paul lachance after the louisiana purchase numerous anglo americans migrated to the city the population of the city doubled in the 1830s and by 1840 new orleans had become the wealthiest and the third most populous city in the nation large numbers of german and irish immigrants began arriving in the 1840s working as laborers in the busy port in this period the state legislature passed more restrictions on manumissions of slaves and virtually ended it in 1852 in the 1850s white francophones remained an intact and vibrant community they maintained instruction in french in two of the city 's four school districts all were white in 1860 the city had 13000 free people of color gens de couleur libres the class of free mostly mixed race people that developed during french and spanish rule the census recorded 81 percent as mulatto a term used to cover all degrees of mixed race mostly part of the francophone group they constituted the artisan educated and professional class of african americans most blacks were still enslaved working at the port in domestic service in crafts and mostly on the many large surrounding sugar cane plantations after growing by 45 percent in the 1850s by 1860 the city had nearly 170000 people the city was a destination for immigrants it had grown in wealth with a per capita income that was second in the nation and the highest in the south the city had a role as the primary commercial gateway for the nation 's booming mid section the port was the third largest in the nation in terms of tonnage of imported goods after boston and new york handling 659000 tons in 1859 as the french creole elite feared during the civil war their world changed in 1862 following the occupation by the navy after the battle of forts jackson and st philip northern forces under gen benjamin f butler a respected state lawyer of the massachusetts militia occupied the city later new orleans residents nicknamed him as beast butler because of a military order he issued after his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by southern women his order warned that future such occurrences would result in his men treating such ladies as those plying their avocation in the streets implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes accounts of this spread like wildfire across the south and the north he also came to be called spoons butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying new orleans butler abolished french language instruction in city schools statewide measures in 1864 and after the war 1868 further strengthened english only policy imposed by federal representatives with the predominance of english speakers in the city and state that language had already become dominant in business and government by the end of the 19th century french usage in the city had faded significantly it was also under pressure from new immigrants english speakers such as the irish and other europeans such as the italians and germans however as late as 1902 one fourth of the population of the city spoke french in ordinary daily intercourse while another two fourths was able to understand the language perfectly and as late as 1945 one still encountered elderly creole women who spoke no english the last major french language newspaper in new orleans l'abeille de la nouvelle orl ans new orleans bee ceased publication on december 27 1923 after ninety six years according to some sources le courrier de la nouvelle orleans continued until 1955 as the city was captured and occupied early in the war it was spared the destruction through warfare suffered by many other cities of the american south the union army eventually extended its control north along the mississippi river and along the coastal areas of the state as a result most of the southern portion of louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 emancipation proclamation issued by president abraham lincoln large numbers of rural ex slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of black troops in the war led by brig gen daniel ullman 1810 1892 of the 78th regiment of new york state volunteers militia they were known as the corps d'afrique while that name had been used by a militia before the war that group was composed of free people of color the new group was made up mostly of former slaves they were supplemented in the last two years of the war by newly organized united states colored troops who played an increasingly important part in the war violence throughout the south especially the memphis riots of 1866 followed by the new orleans riot in july of that year resulted in congress passing the reconstruction act and the fourteenth amendment to extend the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color louisiana and texas were put under the authority of the fifth military district of the united states during reconstruction louisiana was eventually readmitted to the union in 1868 its constitution of 1868 granted universal manhood suffrage and established universal public education both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices in 1872 lieutenant governor p b s pinchback who was of mixed race succeeded henry clay warmouth for a brief period as republican governor of louisiana becoming the first governor of african descent of an american state the next african american to serve as governor of an american state was douglas wilder elected in virginia in 1989 new orleans even operated a racially integrated public school system during this period wartime damage to levees and cities along the mississippi river adversely affected southern crops and trade for the port city for some time the federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure but it took time the nationwide financial recession and panic of 1873 also adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery from 1868 elections in louisiana were marked by violence as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt republican gatherings violence continued around elections the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years the white league an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the democratic party was organized in 1874 and operated in the open violently suppressing the black vote and running off republican officeholders in 1874 in the battle of liberty place 5000 members of the white league fought with city police to take over the state offices for the democratic candidate for governor holding them for three days by 1876 such tactics resulted in the white democrats the so called redeemers regaining political control of the state legislature the federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877 ending reconstruction white democrats passed jim crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities in 1889 the legislature passed a constitutional amendment incorporating a grandfather clause that effectively disfranchised freedmen as well as the propertied people of color free before the war unable to vote african americans could not serve on juries or in local office and were closed out of formal politics for several generations in the state it was ruled by a white democratic party public schools were racially segregated and remained so until 1960 new orleans' large community of well educated often french speaking free persons of color gens de couleur libres who had been free prior to the civil war sought to fight back against jim crow they organized the comit des citoyens citizens committee to work for civil rights as part of their legal campaign they recruited one of their own homer plessy to test whether louisiana 's newly enacted separate car act was constitutional plessy boarded a commuter train departing new orleans for covington louisiana sat in the car reserved for whites only and was arrested the case resulting from this incident plessy v ferguson was heard by the u s supreme court in 1896 the court ruled that separate but equal accommodations were constitutional effectively upholding jim crow measures in practice african american public schools and facilities were underfunded in louisiana and across the south the supreme court ruling contributed to this period as the nadir of race relations in the united states the rate of lynchings of black men was high across the south as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose jim crow to establish white supremacy anti italian sentiment in 1891 contributed to the hanging of 11 italians charged with murder it was the largest mass lynching in u s history throughout new orleans' history until the early 20th century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation the city suffered repeated epidemics of yellow fever and other tropical and infectious diseases 20th century new orleans' zenith as an economic and population center in relation to other american cities occurred in the decades prior to 1860 at this time new orleans was the nation 's fifth largest city and was significantly larger than all other american south population centers new orleans continued to increase in population from the mid 19th century onward but rapid economic growth shifted to other areas of the country meaning that new orleans' relative importance steadily declined first to emerge in importance were the new industrial and railroad hubs of the midwest then the rapidly growing metropolises of the pacific coast in the decades before and after the turn of the 20th century construction of railways and highways decreased river traffic diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets thousands of the most ambitious blacks left new orleans and the state in the great migration around world war ii and after many for west coast destinations in the post war period other sun belt cities in the south and west surpassed new orleans in population from the late 1800s most u s censuses recorded new orleans' slipping rank among american cities reminded every ten years of its declining relative importance new orleans would periodically mount attempts to regain its economic vigor and pre eminence with varying degrees of success by the mid 20th century new orleanians recognized that their city was being surpassed as the leading urban area in the south by 1950 houston dallas and atlanta exceeded new orleans in size and in 1960 miami eclipsed new orleans even as the latter 's population reached what would be its historic peak that year as with other older american cities in the postwar period highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside the 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in the city 's population since it joined the united states the new orleans metropolitan area continued expanding in population however just not as rapidly as other major cities in the sun belt while the port remained one of the largest in the nation automation and containerization resulted in significant job losses the city 's relative fall in stature meant that its former role as banker to the south was inexorably supplanted by competing companies in larger peer cities new orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing but the city 's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank in the post world war ii period despite some economic development successes under the administrations of delesseps chep morrison 1946 1961 and victor vic schiro 1961 1970 metropolitan new orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities civil rights movement during the later years of morrison 's administration and for the entirety of schiro 's the city was a center of the civil rights movement the southern christian leadership conference was founded in the city lunch counter sit ins were held in canal street stores and a prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation following the supreme court ruling in brown v board of education 1954 when six year old ruby bridges integrated william frantz elementary school in the city 's ninth ward she was the first child of color to attend a previously all white school in the south the civil rights movement 's success in gaining federal passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 provided enforcement of constitutional rights including voting for blacks together these resulted in the most far reaching changes in new orleans' 20th century history though legal and civil equality were re established by the end of the 1960s a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city 's white and african american communities as the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city its population 's income level dropped and it became proportionately more african american from 1980 the african american majority has elected officials from its own community they have struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the african american community new orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay by the administrations of sidney barthelemy 1986 1994 and marc morial 1994 2002 relatively low levels of educational attainment high rates of household poverty and rising crime threatened the prosperity of the city in the later decades of the century the negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions contrasted with the changes to the economy of the united states which were based on a post industrial knowledge based paradigm in which mental skills and education were far more important to advancement than manual skills drainage and flood control in the 20th century new orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city 's expansion the most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor a baldwin wood designed to break the surrounding swamp 's stranglehold on the city 's geographic expansion until then urban development in new orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and bayous wood 's pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low lying areas over the 20th century rapid subsidence both natural and human induced resulted in these newly populated areas declining to several feet below sea level new orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the city 's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the mississippi river in the late 20th century however scientists and new orleans residents gradually became aware of the city 's increased vulnerability in 1965 flooding from hurricane betsy killed dozens of residents although the majority of the city remained dry the rain induced flood of may 8 1995 demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system after that event measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity by the 1980s and 1990s scientists observed that extensive rapid and ongoing erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding new orleans especially that related to the mississippi river gulf outlet canal had the unintended result of leaving the city more exposed to hurricane induced catastrophic storm surges than earlier in its history 21st century hurricane katrina new orleans was catastrophically affected by what the university of california berkeley 's dr raymond b seed called the worst engineering disaster in the world since chernobyl when the federal levee system failed during hurricane katrina in 2005 by the time the hurricane approached the city at the end of august 2005 most residents had evacuated as the hurricane passed through the gulf coast region the city 's federal flood protection system failed resulting in the worst civil engineering disaster in american history floodwalls and levees constructed by the united states army corps of engineers failed below design specifications and 80 of the city flooded tens of thousands of residents who had remained in the city were rescued or otherwise made their way to shelters of last resort at the louisiana superdome or the new orleans morial convention center more than 1500 people were recorded as having died in louisiana most in new orleans and others are still unaccounted for before hurricane katrina the city called for the first mandatory evacuation in its history to be followed by another mandatory evacuation three years later with hurricane gustav hurricane rita the city was declared off limits to residents while efforts to clean up after hurricane katrina began the approach of hurricane rita in september 2005 caused repopulation efforts to be postponed and the lower ninth ward was reflooded by rita 's storm surge post disaster recovery because of the scale of damage many people settled permanently outside the city in other areas where they had evacuated as in houston federal state and local efforts have been directed at recovery and rebuilding in severely damaged neighborhoods the census bureau in july 2006 estimated the population of new orleans to be 223000 a subsequent study estimated that 32000 additional residents had moved to the city as of march 2007 bringing the estimated population to 255000 approximately 56 of the pre katrina population level another estimate based on data on utility usage from july 2007 estimated the population to be approximately 274000 or 60 of the pre katrina population these estimates are somewhat smaller than a third estimate based on mail delivery records from the greater new orleans community data center in june 2007 which indicated that the city had regained approximately two thirds of its pre katrina population in 2008 the census bureau revised its population estimate for the city upward to 336644 most recently 2010 estimates show that neighborhoods that did not flood are near 100 of their pre katrina populations and in some cases exceed 100 of their pre katrina populations several major tourist events and other forms of revenue for the city have returned large conventions are being held again such as those held by the american library association and american college of cardiology college football events such as the bayou classic new orleans bowl and sugar bowl returned for the 2006 2007 season the new orleans saints returned that season as well following speculation of a move the new orleans hornets now named the pelicans returned to the city fully for the 2007 2008 season having partially spent the 2006 2007 season in oklahoma city new orleans successfully hosted the 2008 nba all star game and the 2008 bcs national championship game the city hosted the first and second rounds of the 2007 ncaa men 's division i basketball tournament new orleans and tulane university hosted the final four championship in 2012 additionally the city hosted the super bowl xlvii on february 3 2013 at the mercedes benz superdome major annual events such as mardi gras and the jazz heritage festival were never displaced or canceled also an entirely new annual festival the running of the bulls new orleans was created in 2007 geography new orleans is located at 29 57 53 n 90 4 14 w 29 964722 90 070556 on the banks of the mississippi river approximately 105 miles 169 km upriver from the gulf of mexico according to the u s census bureau the city has a total area of 350 square miles 910 km2 of which 169 square miles 440 km2 is land and 181 square miles 470 km2 52 is water orleans parish is the smallest parish by land area in louisiana the city is located in the mississippi river delta on the east and west banks of the mississippi river and south of lake pontchartrain the area along the river is characterized by ridges and hollows new orleans was originally settled on the natural levees or high ground along the mississippi river after the flood control act of 1965 the us army corps of engineers built floodwalls and man made levees around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp whether or not this human interference has caused subsidence is a topic of debate a study by an associate professor at tulane university claims on the other hand a report by the american society of civil engineers claims that new orleans is subsiding sinking in may 2016 nasa published a study that details the sinking rate of new orleans a recent study by tulane and xavier university notes that 51 of new orleans is at or above sea level with the more densely populated areas generally on higher ground the average elevation of the city is currently between one and two feet 0 5 m below sea level with some portions of the city as high as 20 feet 6 m at the base of the river levee in uptown and others as low as 7 feet 2 m below sea level in the farthest reaches of eastern new orleans in 2005 storm surge from hurricane katrina caused catastrophic failure of the federally designed and built levees flooding 80 of the city a report by the american society of civil engineers says that had the levees and floodwalls not failed and had the pump stations operated nearly two thirds of the deaths would not have occurred new orleans has always had to consider the risk of hurricanes but the risks are dramatically greater today due to coastal erosion from human interference since the beginning of the 20th century it has been estimated that louisiana has lost 2000 square miles 5000 km2 of coast including many of its barrier islands which once protected new orleans against storm surge following hurricane katrina the army corps of engineers has instituted massive levee repair and hurricane protection measures to protect the city in 2006 louisiana voters overwhelmingly adopted an amendment to the state 's constitution to dedicate all revenues from off shore drilling to restore louisiana 's eroding coast line congress has allocated 7 billion to bolster new orleans' flood protection according to a study by the national academy of engineering and the national research council levees and floodwalls surrounding new orleans no matter how large or sturdy cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges not as measures that completely eliminate risk for structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate the committee recommended major floodproofing measures such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100 year flood level cityscape the central business district of new orleans is located immediately north and west of the mississippi river and was historically called the american quarter or american sector it was developed after the heart of french and spanish settlement it includes lafayette square most streets in this area fan out from a central point in the city major streets of the area include canal street poydras street tulane avenue and loyola avenue canal street functions as the street which divides the traditional downtown area from the uptown area every street crossing canal street between the mississippi river and rampart street which is the northern edge of the french quarter has a different name for the uptown and downtown portions for example st charles avenue known for its street car line is called royal street below canal street though where it traverses the central business district between canal and lee circle it is properly called st charles street elsewhere in the city canal street serves as the dividing point between the south and north portions of various streets in the local parlance downtown means downriver from canal street while uptown means upriver from canal street downtown neighborhoods include the french quarter trem the 7th ward faubourg marigny bywater the upper ninth ward and the lower ninth ward uptown neighborhoods include the warehouse district the lower garden district the garden district the irish channel the university district carrollton gert town fontainebleau and broadmoor however the warehouse and the central business district despite being above canal street are frequently called downtown as a specific region as in the downtown development district other major districts within the city include bayou st john mid city gentilly lakeview lakefront new orleans east and algiers historic and residential architecture new orleans is world famous for its abundance of unique architectural styles which reflect the city 's historical roots and multicultural heritage though new orleans possesses numerous structures of national architectural significance it is equally if not more revered for its enormous largely intact even post katrina historic built environment twenty national register historic districts have been established and fourteen local historic districts aid in the preservation of this tout ensemble thirteen of the local historic districts are administered by the new orleans historic district landmarks commission hdlc while one the french quarter is administered by the vieux carre commission vcc additionally both the national park service via the national register of historic places and the hdlc have landmarked individual buildings many of which lie outside the boundaries of existing historic districts many styles of housing exist in the city including the shotgun house and the bungalow style creole townhouses notable for their large courtyards and intricate iron balconies line the streets of the french quarter throughout the city there are many other historic housing styles creole cottages american townhouses double gallery houses and raised center hall cottages st charles avenue is famed for its large antebellum homes its mansions are in various styles such as greek revival american colonial and the victorian styles of queen anne and italianate architecture new orleans is also noted for its large european style catholic cemeteries which can be found throughout the city tallest buildings for much of its history new orleans' skyline consisted of only low and mid rise structures the soft soils of new orleans are susceptible to subsidence and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing large high rises in such an environment developments in engineering throughout the twentieth century eventually made it possible to build sturdy foundations to support high rise structures in the city and in the 1960s the world trade center new orleans and plaza tower were built demonstrating the viability of tall skyscrapers in new orleans one shell square took its place as the city 's tallest building in 1972 the oil boom of the 1970s and early 1980s redefined new orleans' skyline with the development of the poydras street corridor today most of new orleans' tallest buildings are clustered along canal street and poydras street in the central business district climate the climate of new orleans is humid subtropical k ppen climate classification cfa with short generally mild winters and hot humid summers most suburbs and parts of wards 9 and 15 fall in usda plant hardiness zone 9a while the city 's other 15 wards are rated 9b in whole the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 53 4 f 11 9 c in january to 83 3 f 28 5 c in july and august officially as measured at new orleans international airport temperature records range from 11 to 102 f 12 to 39 c on december 23 1989 and august 22 1980 respectively audubon park has recorded temperatures ranging from 6 f 14 c on february 13 1899 up to 104 f 40 c on june 24 2009 dewpoints in the summer months june august are relatively high ranging

accompanies the passing of a cold front on average there are 77 days of 90 f 32 c highs 8 1 days per winter where the high does not exceed 50 f 10 c and 8 0 nights with freezing lows annually it is rare for the temperature to reach 20 or 100 f 7 or 38 c with the last occurrence of each being february 5 1996 and june 26 2016 respectively hurricanes pose a severe threat to the area and the city is particularly at risk because of its low elevation because it is surrounded by water from the north east and south and because of louisiana 's sinking coast according to the federal emergency management agency new orleans is the nation 's most vulnerable city to hurricanes indeed portions of greater new orleans have been flooded by the grand isle hurricane of 1909 the new orleans hurricane of 1915 1947 fort lauderdale hurricane hurricane flossy in 1956 hurricane betsy in 1965 hurricane georges in 1998 hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 and hurricane gustav in 2008 with the flooding in betsy being significant and in a few neighborhoods severe and that in katrina being disastrous in the majority of the city new orleans experiences snowfall only on rare occasions a small amount of snow fell during the 2004 christmas eve snowstorm and again on christmas december 25 when a combination of rain sleet and snow fell on the city leaving some bridges icy before that the last white christmas was in 1964 and brought 4 5 inches 11 cm snow fell again on december 22 1989 when most of the city received 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm the last significant snowfall in new orleans was on the morning of december 11 2008 demographics according to the 2010 census 343829 people and 189896 households were in new orleans the racial and ethnic makeup of the city was 60 2 african american 33 0 white 2 9 asian 1 7 vietnamese 0 3 indian 0 3 chinese 0 1 filipino 0 1 korean 0 0 pacific islander and 1 7 were people of two or more races people of hispanic or latino origin made up 5 3 of the population 1 3 of new orleans is mexican 1 3 honduran 0 4 cuban 0 3 puerto rican and 0 3 nicaraguan the last population estimate before hurricane katrina was 454865 as of july 1 2005 a population analysis released in august 2007 estimated the population to be 273000 60 of the pre katrina population and an increase of about 50000 since july 2006 a september 2007 report by the greater new orleans community data center which tracks population based on u s postal service figures found that in august 2007 just over 137000 households received mail that compares with about 198000 households in july 2005 representing about 70 of pre katrina population more recently the census bureau revised upward its 2008 population estimate for the city to 336644 inhabitants in 2010 estimates showed that neighborhoods that did not flood were near 100 of their pre katrina populations and in some cases exceeded 100 of their pre katrina populations a 2006 study by researchers at tulane university and the university of california berkeley determined that there are as many as 10000 to 14000 undocumented immigrants many from mexico currently residing in new orleans janet murgu a president and chief executive officer of the national council of la raza stated that there could be up to 120000 hispanic workers in new orleans in june 2007 one study stated that the hispanic population had risen from 15000 pre katrina to over 50000 a recent article released by the times picayune indicated that the metropolitan area had undergone a recent influx of 5300 households in the later half of 2008 bringing the population to around 469605 households or 88 1 of its pre katrina levels while the area 's population has been on an upward trajectory since the storm much of that growth was attributed to residents returning after katrina many observers predicted that growth would taper off but the data center 's analysis suggests that new orleans and the surrounding parishes are benefiting from an economic migration resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 as of 2010 90 31 of new orleans residents age 5 and older spoke english at home as a primary language while 4 84 spoke spanish 1 87 vietnamese and 1 05 spoke french in total 9 69 of new orleans 's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than english religion new orleans' colonial history of french and spanish settlement has resulted in a strong catholic tradition catholic missions administered to slaves and free people of color establishing schools for them in addition many late 19th and early 20th century european immigrants such as the irish some germans and italians were catholic in new orleans and the surrounding louisiana gulf coast area the predominant religion is catholicism within the archdiocese of new orleans which includes not only the city but the surrounding parishes as well 35 9 percent of the population is roman catholic the influence of catholicism is reflected in many of the city 's french and spanish cultural traditions including its many parochial schools street names architecture and festivals including mardi gras new orleans also notably has a distinctive variety of louisiana voodoo due in part to syncretism with african and afro caribbean roman catholic beliefs the fame of the voodoo practitioner marie laveau contributed to this as did new orleans' distinctly caribbean cultural influences although the tourism industry has strongly associated voodoo with the city only a small number of people are serious adherents to the religion jewish settlers primarily sephardim were part of new orleans from the early nineteenth century some migrated from the communities established in the colonial years in charleston south carolina and savannah georgia the merchant abraham cohen labatt helped found the first jewish congregation in louisiana in the 1830s which became known as the portuguese jewish nefutzot yehudah congregation as he and some other members were sephardic jews whose ancestors had lived in portugal and spain jews from eastern europe came as immigrants in the late 19th and 20th centuries by the 21st century there were 10000 jews in new orleans this number dropped to 7000 after the disruption of hurricane katrina in the wake of katrina all new orleans synagogues lost members but most re opened in their original locations the exception was congregation beth israel the oldest and most prominent orthodox synagogue in the new orleans region beth israel 's building in lakeview was destroyed by flooding after seven years of holding services in temporary quarters a rebuilt synagogue was consecrated in august 2012 on land purchased from its new neighbor the reform congregation gates of prayer in metairie ethnic groups as of 2011 there had been increases in the hispanic population in the new orleans area including in kenner central metairie and terrytown in jefferson parish and eastern new orleans and mid city in new orleans proper prior to hurricane katrina there were few persons of brazilian origin in the city but after katrina and by 2008 a population emerged with portuguese speakers becoming the second most common english as a second language group in the roman catholic archdiocese of new orleans sponsored esl classes after the spanish speakers many brazilians worked in skilled trades such as tile and flooring with fewer day laborers many of them moved from brazilian communities in the northeastern united states florida and georgia and brazilians settled throughout the new orleans metropolitan area most of the brazilians were undocumented immigrants in january 2008 bruce nolan of the houston chronicle stated that the midrange of the various estimations and guesses of the new orleans brazilian population wa 3000 but that no entity or organization had determined exactly how many brazilians resided in the city by 2008 many small churches shops and restaurants catering to brazilians in the new orleans area opened changes in population the city of new orleans faced a decreasing population before and after hurricane katrina beginning in 1960 the population of the city decreased due to several factors such as the city 's reliance on oil and tourism nationwide increases in suburbanization and a migration of jobs to surrounding parishes this economic and population decline is linked to high levels of poverty which in 1960 was the fifth highest of all us cities and was almost twice the national average in 2005 at 24 5 furthermore new orleans experienced an increase in residential segregation from 1900 to 1980 leaving the poor who were disproportionately african american in low lying locations within the city 's core making them especially susceptible to flood and storm damage hurricane katrina which displaced 800000 people in total contributed significantly to continue shrinking new orleans' population as of 2010 the population of new orleans was at 76 of what it was in 2005 african americans renters the elderly and people with low income were disproportionately impacted by hurricane katrina compared to affluent and white residents in the aftermath of katrina city government commissioned groups such as bring new orleans back commission the new orleans neighborhood rebuilding plan the unified new orleans plan and the office of recovery management to contribute to plans addressing depopulation their ideas included shrinking the city 's footprint from before the storm incorporating community voices into development plans and creating green spaces some of which incited controversy from 2010 to 2014 the city grew by 12 adding an average of more than 10000 new residents each year following the 2010 census economy new orleans has one of the largest and busiest ports in

rock and roll an example of the new orleans' sound in the 1960s is the 1 us hit chapel of love by the dixie cups a song which knocked the beatles out of the top spot on the billboard hot 100 new

accent so often misportrayed by film and television actors it does like earlier southern englishes feature frequent deletion of the pre consonantal r this dialect is quite similar to new york city area accents such as brooklynese to people unfamiliar with either there are many theories regarding how it came to be but it likely resulted from new orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century as a result many of the ethnic groups who reside in brooklyn also reside in new orleans such as the irish italians especially sicilians and germans among others as well as a very sizable jewish community one of the strongest varieties of the new orleans accent is sometimes identified as the yat dialect from the greeting where y'at this distinctive accent is dying out generation by generation in the city itself but remains very strong in the surrounding parishes less visibly various ethnic groups throughout

government the city of new orleans and the parish of orleans operate as a merged city parish government before the city of new orleans became co extensive with orleans parish orleans parish was home to numerous smaller communities the original city of new orleans was composed of what are now the 1st through 9th wards the city of lafayette including the garden district was added in 1852 as the 10th and 11th wards in 1870 jefferson city including faubourg bouligny and much of the audubon and university areas was annexed as the 12th 13th and 14th wards algiers on the west bank of the mississippi was also annexed in 1870 becoming the 15th ward new orleans' government is now largely centralized in the city council and mayor 's office but it maintains a number of relics from earlier systems when various sections of the city ran much of their affairs separately for example new orleans has seven elected tax assessors each with their own staff representing various districts of the city rather than one centralized office a constitutional amendment passed on november 7 2006 will consolidate the seven assessors into one by 2010 on february 18 2010 errol williams was elected as the first citywide assessor the new orleans government operates both a fire department and the new orleans emergency medical services crime and safety crime has been recognized as an ongoing problem for new orleans although the issue is outside the view of most visitors to the city as in other u s cities of comparable size the incidence of homicide and other violent crimes is highly concentrated in certain impoverished neighborhoods such as housing projects in 2012 travel leisure named new orleans the 2 america 's dirtiest city down from a 1 dirtiest status of the previous year the magazine surveyed both national readership and local residents from a list of prominent cities having the most visible illegal littering dumping and other environmental crime conditions across new orleans homicides peaked in 1994 at 86 murders per 100000 residents by 2009 despite a 17 decrease in violent crime in the city the homicide rate remained among the highest in the united states at between 55 and 64 per 100000 residents in 2010 new orleans was 49 1 per 100000 and in 2012 that number climbed to 53 2 this is the highest rate among cities of 250000 population or larger offenders in new orleans are almost exclusively black men with 97 of the offenders being black and 95 being male the violent crime rate was also a key issue in the city 's 2010 mayoral race in january 2007 several thousand new orleans residents marched through city streets and gathered at city hall for a rally demanding police and city leaders tackle the crime problem then mayor ray nagin said he was totally and solely focused on addressing the problem later the city implemented checkpoints during late night hours in problem areas the murder rate climbed 14 higher in 2011 to 57 88 per 100000 retaining its status as the 'murder capital of the united states' and rising to 21 in the world education colleges and universities there are several higher education institutions in the city tulane university a major research university founded in 1834 loyola university new orleans a jesuit university founded in 1912 university of new orleans a large public research university in the city xavier university

primary and secondary schools new orleans public schools nops is the name given to the city 's public school system pre katrina nops was one of the area 's largest systems along with the jefferson parish public school system in the years leading up to hurricane katrina the new orleans public school system was widely recognized as the lowest performing school district in louisiana according to researchers carl l bankston and stephen j caldas only 12 of the 103 public schools within the city limits of new orleans showed reasonably good performance at the beginning of the 21st century following hurricane katrina the state of louisiana took over most of the schools within the system all schools that fell into a nominal worst performing metric many of these schools in addition to others that were not subject to state takeover were subsequently granted operating charters giving them administrative independence from the orleans parish school board the recovery school district and or the louisiana board of elementary and secondary education bese at the start of the 2014 school year all public school students in the nops system will attend these independent public charter schools making new orleans the nation 's first completely privatized public school district in the nation the last few years have witnessed significant and sustained gains in student achievement as outside operators like kipp the algiers charter school network and the capital one university of new orleans charter school network have assumed control of dozens of schools the most recent release of annual school performance scores october 2009 demonstrated continued growth in the academic performance of new orleans' public schools if the scores of all public schools in new orleans orleans parish school board chartered recovery school district chartered recovery school district operated etc are considered an overall school district performance score of 70 6 results this score represents a 6 increase over an equivalent 2008 metric and a 24 improvement when measured against an equivalent pre katrina 2004 metric when a district score of 56 9 was posted notably this score of 70 6 approaches the score 78 4 posted in 2009 by the adjacent suburban jefferson parish public school system though that system 's performance score is itself below the state average of 91 this longstanding pattern is changing however as the nops system is engaged in the most promising and far reaching public school reforms in the nation reforms aimed at decentralizing power away from the pre katrina school board central bureaucracy to individual school principals and independent public charter school boards monitoring charter school performance by granting renewable five year operating contracts permitting the closure of those not succeeding and vesting choice in parents of public schools students allowing them to enroll their children in almost any school in the district libraries there are

of tampa was once inhabited by indigenous peoples of the safety harbor culture most notably the tocobaga and the pohoy who lived along the shores of tampa bay the area was explored by spanish explorers in the 16th century resulting in violent conflicts and the introduction of european diseases which wiped out the original native cultures although spain claimed florida as part of new spain it did not found a colony in the tampa area and there were no permanent american or european settlements within today 's city limits until after the united states acquired florida from spain in 1819 in 1824 the united states army established a frontier outpost called fort brooke at the mouth of the hillsborough river near the site of today 's tampa convention center the first civilian residents were pioneers who settled near the fort for protection from the nearby seminole population and the small village was first incorporated as tampa in 1849 the town grew slowly until the 1880s when railroad links the discovery of phosphate and the arrival of the cigar industry jump started its development helping it to grow from a quiet village of less than 800 residents in 1880 to a bustling

language of the calusa a native american tribe that once lived south of today 's tampa bay this might be a reference to the many lightning strikes that the area receives during the summer months other historians claim the name means the place to gather sticks toponymist george r stewart writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the spanish and the indians the indian word being itimpi meaning simply near it the name first appears in the memoir of hernando de escalante fontaneda 1575 who had spent 17 years as a calusa captive he calls it tanpa and describes it as an important calusa town while tanpa may be the basis for the modern name tampa archaeologist jerald milanich places the calusa village of tanpa at the mouth of charlotte harbor the original bay of tanpa a later spanish expedition did not notice charlotte harbor while sailing north along the west coast of florida and assumed that the current tampa bay was the bay they sought the name was accidentally transferred north map makers were using the term bay or bahia tampa as early as 1695 people from tampa are known as tampans or tampanians local authorities consulted by michael kruse of the tampa bay times suggest that tampan was historically more common while tampanian became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult latin americans from tampa are known as tampe os or tampe as for females these terms of spanish origin emerged after 1900 for the immigrant communities in west tampa and ybor city the tampe o or tampa latin community is a mix of cuban italian spanish and american influences with cuban influence being dominant european exploration not much is known about the cultures who called the tampa bay area home before european contact when spanish explorers arrived in the 1520s they found tocobaga villages around the northern half of tampa bay and calusa villages along the southern portion of the bay expeditions led by p nfilo de narv ez and hernando de soto landed near tampa but neither conquistador stayed long the native inhabitants repulsed any spanish attempt to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to catholicism the newcomers brought with them infectious disease resulting in a total collapse of the native cultures of florida the tampa area was depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years in the mid 18th century events in american colonies drove the seminole indians into northern florida during this period the tampa area had only a handful of residents cuban and native american fishermen they lived in a small village at the mouth of spanishtown creek on tampa bay in today 's hyde park neighborhood along bayshore boulevard u s control after purchasing florida from spain in 1821 the united states built forts and trading posts in the new territory fort brooke was established in january 1824 at the mouth of the hillsborough river on tampa bay in downtown tampa tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost the sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the second seminole war from 1835 to 1842 after which the seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned florida became the 27th state in 1845 on january 18 1849 tampa was officially incorporated as the village of tampa tampa was home to 185 civilians or 974 total residents including military personnel in 1850 tampa was reincorporated as a town on december 15 1855 civil war and reconstruction during the civil war florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the confederate states of america and fort brooke was manned by confederate troops martial law was declared in tampa in january 1862 and tampa 's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war in 1861 the union navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the confederacy and several ships were stationed near the mouth of tampa bay the battle of fort brooke on october 16 and the battle of ballast point on october 18 1863 damaged the confederates with union troops destroying confederate blockade runners the civil war ended in april 1865 with a confederate defeat in may 1865 federal troops arrived in tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of reconstruction they remained until august 1869 tampa was a fishing village with very few people and little industry and limited prospects for development tampa 's chronic yellow fever epidemics borne by mosquitoes from the swampland were widespread during the late 1860s and 1870s and many residents left in 1869 residents voted to abolish the city of tampa government the population of tampa town was below 800 by 1870 and had fallen further by 1880 fort brooke was decommissioned in 1883 and except for two cannons displayed on the university of tampa campus all traces of the fort are gone 1880s economic prosperity in the mid 1880s tampa 's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better first phosphate was discovered in the bone valley region southeast of tampa in 1883 the mineral vital for the production of fertilizers and other products was soon being shipped out from the port of tampa in great volume tampa is still a major phosphate exporter the discovery of phosphate the arrival of plant 's railroad and the founding of ybor city and west tampa all in the mid 1880s were crucial to tampa 's development the once struggling village of tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in florida by 1900 plant 's railroad henry b plant 's narrow gauge south florida railroad reached tampa and its port in late 1883 finally connecting the small town to the nation 's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders previously tampa 's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the florida countryside plant 's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the tampa bay area phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north by rail and many new products were brought into the tampa market along with the first tourists ybor 's cigars the new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to tampa in 1885 the tampa board of trade enticed vicente martinez ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to tampa from key west proximity to cuba made importation of clear havana tobacco easy by sea and plant 's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the us market easy by land since tampa was still a small town at the time population less than 5000 ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly cuban and spanish cigar workers ybor city 's factories rolled their first cigars in 1886 and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years many italian and a few eastern european jewish immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers by 1900 over 10000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood several thousand more cuban immigrants built west tampa another cigar centric suburb founded a few years later by hugh macfarlane between them two latin communities combined to exponentially expand tampa 's population economic base and tax revenues as tampa became the cigar capital of the world early 20th century during the first few decades of the 20th century the cigar making industry was the backbone of tampa 's economy the factories in ybor city and west tampa made an enormous number of cigars in the peak year of 1929 over 500000000 cigars were hand rolled in the city in 1904 a local civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves ye mystic krewe of gasparilla named after local mythical pirate jose gaspar and staged an invasion of the city followed by a parade with a few exceptions the gasparilla pirate festival has been held every year since bolita and organized crime beginning in the late 19th century illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the tampa working classes especially in ybor city in the early 1920s this small time operation was taken over by charlie wall the rebellious son of a prominent tampa family and went big time bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials and many were on the take profits from the bolita lotteries and prohibition era bootlegging led to the development of several organized crime factions in the city charlie wall was the first major boss but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by sicilian mafioso santo trafficante sr and his faction in the 1950s after his death in 1954 from cancer control passed to his son santo trafficante jr who established alliances with families in new york city and extended his power throughout florida and into batista era cuba the era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s when the estes kefauver 's traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in tampa for decades mid to late 20th century tampa grew considerably as a result of world war ii prior to the united states' involvement in the conflict construction began on macdill field the predecessor of present day macdill air force base macdill field served as a main base for army air corps and later army air forces operations just before and during world war ii with multiple auxiliary airfields around the tampa bay area and surrounding counties at the end of the war macdill remained as an active military installation while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control two of these auxiliary fields would later become the present day tampa international airport and st petersburg clearwater international airport with the establishment of an independent u s air force in 1947 macdill field became macdill afb during the 1950s and 1960s tampa saw record setting population growth that has not been seen since this amazing growth spurred major expansion of the city 's highways and bridges bringing thousands into the city and creating endless possibilities for tampa business owners who welcomed tourists and new citizens alike into their neighborhoods it was during this time period in the city 's history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed busch gardens and lowry park many of the well known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of the city were established during this time period the university of south florida was established in north tampa in 1956 and opened for students in september 1960 the school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial development in the previously agriculture dominated area around the new campus overall tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals schools churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas in 1970 the census bureau reported city 's population as 80 0 white and 19 7 black four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government of the city of tampa with the county government of hillsborough county 1967 1970 1971 and 1972 all of which failed at the ballot box the greatest loss was also the most recent attempt in 1972 with the final tally being 33160 31 in favor and 73568 69 against the proposed charter the biggest recent growth in the city was the development of new tampa which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural area of 24 square miles 62 km2 between i 275 and i 75

about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown although some specimens do grow in northern tampa southern tampa has much more tropical foliage than the northern parts of the city summer temperatures are warm to hot from around mid may through mid october which roughly coincides with the rainy season summertime weather is very consistent from june through september with daytime highs near 90 f 32 c lows in the mid 70s f 23 24 c and high humidity afternoon thunderstorms usually generated by the interaction of the gulf and atlantic sea breezes are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the tampa bay area is recognized as the lightning capital of north america every year florida averages 10 deaths and 30 injuries from lightning strikes with several of these usually occurring in or around tampa because of the frequent summer thunderstorms tampa has a pronounced wet season receiving an average of 26 1 inches 663 mm of rain from june to september but only about 18 6 inches 472 mm during the remaining eight months of the year the historical averages during the late summer especially september are augmented by passing tropical systems which can easily dump many inches of rain in one day tropical storm debby in 2012 dropped 8 57 inches 218 mm of rain at tampa international airport on june 24 2012 and amounts up to 10 36 inches 263 mm was

afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into a severe thunderstorm bringing heavy downpours frequent lightning strong straight line winds and sometimes hail tropical systems though it is affected by tropical storms every few years and threatened by tropical systems almost annually tampa has not taken a direct hit from a hurricane since 1921 that seemed about to change in 2004 when hurricane charley was forecast to make landfall near downtown tampa with potentially devastating effects for the entire region the danger prompted the largest evacuation order for pinellas county history and the largest evacuation request in florida since hurricane floyd five years before but charley never reached tampa bay after paralleling florida 's southwest coastline the storm swerved to the east and slammed into punta gorda instead winter in the winter average temperatures range from the low to mid 70s f 21 24 c during the day to the low to mid 50s f 10 13 c at night however sustained colder air pushes into the area on several occasions every winter dropping the highs and lows to 15 f 8 c or more below the seasonal averages for several days at a time the temperature can fall below freezing an average of 2 to 3 times per year though this does not occur every season since the tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze sensitive agriculture and aquaculture hard

district north of sr 91 and east of sr 57 history anaheim 's name is a blend of ana after the nearby santa ana river and heim a common germanic place name compound originally meaning home the city of anaheim was founded in 1857 by 50 german americans who were residents of san francisco and whose families had originated in rothenburg ob der tauber franconia in bavaria after traveling through the state looking for a suitable area to grow grapes the group decided to purchase a 1165 acres 4 71 km2 parcel from juan pacifico ontiveros' large rancho san juan cajon de santa ana in present day orange county for 2 per acre for 750 a share the group formed the anaheim vineyard company their new community was named annaheim meaning home by the santa anna river in german the name later was altered to anaheim to the spanish speaking neighbors the settlement was known as campo alem n english german field although grape and wine making was their primary objective the majority of the 50 settlers were mechanics carpenters and craftsmen with no experience in wine making the community set aside 40 acres 16 ha for a town center and a school was the first building erected there the first home was built in 1857 the anaheim gazette newspaper was established in 1870 and a hotel in 1871 for 25 years the area was the largest wine producer in california however in 1884 a disease infected the grape vines and by the following year the entire industry was destroyed other crops walnuts lemons and oranges soon filled the void fruits and vegetables had become viable cash crops when the los angeles orange county region was connected to the continental railroad network in 1887 the famous polish actress helena modjeska settled in anaheim with her husband and various friends among them henryk sienkiewicz julian sypniewski and ucjan paprocki while living in anaheim helena modjeska became good friends with clementine langenberger the second wife of august langenberger helena street and clementine street

anaheim is also named after helena modjeska during the first half of the 20th century before disneyland opened its doors to the public anaheim was a massive rural community inhabited by orange groves and the landowners who farmed them one of the landowners was bennett payne baxter who owned much land in northeast anaheim that today is the location of angel stadium he came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners he was not only successful he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well ben baxter and other landowners helped to make anaheim a thriving rural community before disneyland changed the city forever today a street runs along edison park which is named baxter street also during this time rudolph boysen served as anaheim 's first park superintendent from 1921 to 1950 boysen created a hybrid berry which walter knott later named the boysenberry after rudy boysen boysen park in east anaheim was also named after him in 1924 ku klux klan members were elected to the anaheim city council on a platform of political reform up until that point the city had been controlled by a long standing business and civic elite that was mostly german american given their tradition of moderate social drinking the german americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day the mayor himself was a former saloon keeper led by the minister of the first christian church the klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non ethnic germans who denounced the elite as corrupt undemocratic and self serving the klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model orderly community one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced at the time the kkk had about 1200 members in orange county the economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous klan members were protestants as were the majority of their opponents however the opposition to the klan also included many catholic germans individuals who joined the klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents and many of the individuals in orange county who joined the klan did so out of a sense of civic activism upon easily winning the local anaheim election in april 1924 the klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be catholic and replaced them with klan appointees the new city council tried to enforce prohibition after its victory the klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer the opposition to kkk 's hold on anaheim politics organized bribed a klansman for their secret membership list and exposed the klansmen running in the state primaries they defeated most of the candidates klan opponents in 1925 took back local government and succeeded in a special election in recalling the klansmen who had been elected in april 1924 the klan in anaheim quickly collapsed its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit and the minister who led the local klavern moved to kansas construction of the disneyland theme park began on july 16

orange county visitor convention bureau an aurora sometimes referred to as a polar light or northern light is a natural light display in the sky predominantly seen in the high latitude arctic and antarctic regions auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma mainly in the form of electrons and protons precipitate them into the upper atmosphere thermosphere exosphere where their energy is lost the resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity the form of the aurora occurring within bands around both polar regions is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes occurrence of terrestrial auroras most auroras occur in a band known as the auroral zone which is typically 3 to 6 wide in latitude and between 10 and 20 from the geomagnetic poles at all local times or longitudes most clearly seen at night against a dark sky a region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval a band displaced towards the nightside of the earth early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations elias loomis 1860 and later hermann fritz 1881 and s tromholt 1882 in more detail established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone day to day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet in northern latitudes the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights the former term was coined by galileo in 1619 from the roman goddess of the dawn and the greek name for the north wind the southern counterpart the aurora australis or the southern lights has features that are almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone the aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in antarctica chile argentina new zealand and australia a geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals north and south to expand and bring the aurora to lower latitudes it was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole which is about 2000 km away from the magnetic pole the instantaneous distribution of auroras auroral oval is slightly different being centered about 3 5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the sun the aurora can be seen best at this time which is called magnetic midnight auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead but from farther away they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow or sometimes a faint red as if the sun were rising from an unusual direction auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs which can be sub visual auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the eleven year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak an aurora may appear overhead as a corona of rays radiating from a distant and apparent central location which results from perspective an electron spirals gyrates about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors parallel and perpendicular respectively to the local geomagnetic field vector b this angle is known as the pitch angle of the particle the distance or radius of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its larmor radius the pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere thus it is possible for some particles to return or mirror if the angle becomes 90 degrees before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes other types of auroras have been observed from space e g poleward arcs stretching sunward across the polar cap the related theta aurora and dayside arcs near noon these are relatively infrequent and poorly understood there are other interesting effects such as flickering aurora black aurora and sub visual red arcs in addition to all these a weak glow often deep red observed around the two polar cusps the field lines separating the ones that close through the earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely images the altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by carl st rmer and his colleagues who used cameras to triangulate more than 12000 auroras they discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground while extending at times to more than 1000 km images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties due to the different color spectrum present and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure the results are somewhat unpredictable different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels and choice of film can be very important longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess david malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately for scientific research proxies are often used such as ultra violet and color correction to simulate the appearance to humans predictive techniques are also used to indicate the extent of the display a highly useful tool for aurora hunters terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites it is possible to take excellent images with standard film using iso ratings between 100 and 400 and a single lens reflex camera with full aperture a fast lens f1 4 50 mm for example and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds depending on the aurora 's brightness early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the university of saskatchewan using the scr 270 radar visual forms and colors auroras frequently appears either as a diffuse glow or as curtains that extend approximately in the east west direction at some times they form quiet arcs at others they evolve and change constantly these are called active aurora the most distinctive and brightest are the curtain like auroral arcs each curtain consists of many parallel rays each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field consistent with auroras being shaped by earth 's magnetic field in situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field and spiral around them while moving toward earth the similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs arcs can fragment or break up into separate at times rapidly changing often rayed features that may fill the whole sky these are the discrete auroras which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night and can display rapid sub second variations in intensity the diffuse aurora on the other hand is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility it can be distinguished from moonlit clouds by the fact that stars can be seen undiminished through the glow diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near regular pulsations the pulsation period can be typically many seconds so is not always obvious often there black aurora i e narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity a typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night red at the highest altitudes excited atomic oxygen emits at 630 0 nm red low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity the low amount of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the curtains scarlet crimson and carmine are the most often seen hues of red for the auroras green at lower altitudes the more frequent collisions suppress the 630 0 nm red mode rather the 557 7 nm emission green dominates fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common the excited molecular nitrogen atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the n2 molecule plays a role here as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom which then radiates it away at the green wavelength red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues the rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt looking end of the lower edges of the curtains both the 557 7 and 630 0 nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality 0 7 s and 107 s respectively of flaring and fading blue at yet lower altitudes atomic oxygen is uncommon and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen takes over in producing visible light emission radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum with 428 nm blue being dominant blue and purple emissions typically at the lower edges of the curtains show up at the highest levels of solar activity the molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones ultraviolet ultraviolet light from auroras within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans has been observed with the requisite equipment ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on mars jupiter and saturn infrared infrared light in wavelengths that are within the optical window is also part of many auroras yellow and pink are a mix of red and green or blue other shades of red as well as orange may be seen on rare occasions yellow green is moderately common as red green and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours in theory practically any colour might be possible but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list other auroral radiation in addition the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 khz known as auroral kilometric radiation akr discovered in 1972 ionospheric absorption makes akr only observable from space x ray emissions originating from the particles associated with auroras have also been detected aurora noise aurora noise similar to a hissing or crackling noise begins approximately 70 meters 230 feet above the earth s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night the charged particles discharge when particles from the sun hit the inversion layer creating the noise causes of auroras a full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with the earth s magnetosphere the varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios a quiescent solar wind flowing past the earth s magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are open as opposed to being closed in the opposite hemisphere and provide diffusion through the bow shock it can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly and the loss cone becomes depleted in the magnetotail however particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator as a result the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions isotropic and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons the leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere such replacement of hot electrons by cold ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics the complete process which also generates an electric ring current around the earth is uncertain geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail magnetic substorms these substorms tend to occur after prolonged spells hours during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component this leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of earth as a result the solar wind moves magnetic flux tubes of magnetic field lines locked together with their resident plasma from the day side of earth to the magnetotail widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night side ultimately some tail plasma can separate magnetic reconnection some blobs plasmoids are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind others are squeezed toward earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras mainly around midnight unloading process a geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around earth also producing enhancement of the ring current occasionally the resulting modification of the earth 's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora this mechanism which is believed to predominantly arise from wave particle interactions raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field the pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere the details of these phenomena are not fully understood however it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field coupled with particle acceleration processes auroral particles the immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960 when a pioneering rocket flight from fort churchill in canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone the main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere these electrons often but not always exhibit a peak in their energy distribution and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have in contrast a smoothly falling energy distribution and an angular pitch angle distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines protons are also associated with auroras both discrete and diffuse auroras and the atmosphere auroras result from emissions of photons in the earth 's upper atmosphere above 80 km 50 mi from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state they are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere both incoming electrons and protons may be involved excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon or by collision with another atom or molecule oxygen emissions green or orange red depending on the amount of energy absorbed nitrogen emissions blue or red blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized red if returning to ground state from an excited state oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere so that red emissions do not have time to happen and eventually even green light emissions are prevented this is why there is a color differential with altitude at high altitudes oxygen red dominates then oxygen green and nitrogen blue red then finally nitrogen blue red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything green is the most common color then comes pink a mixture of light green and red followed by pure red then yellow a mixture of red and green and finally pure blue auroras and the ionosphere bright auroras are generally associated with birkeland currents schield et al 1969 zmuda and armstrong 1973 which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other in between some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric e layer 125 km the rest region 2 detours leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the partial ring current carried by magnetically trapped plasma the ionosphere is an ohmic conductor so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage which an as yet unspecified dynamo mechanism can supply electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40000 volts rising up to more than 200000 volts during intense magnetic storms in another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave particle interactions ionospheric resistance has a complex nature and leads to a secondary hall current flow by a strange twist of physics the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current the auroral electrojet an auroral electrojet index measured in nanotesla is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity kristian birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east west directions along the auroral arc and such currents flowing from the dayside toward approximately midnight were later named auroral electrojets see also birkeland currents interaction of the solar wind with earth the earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind a rarefied flow of hot plasma a gas of free electrons and positive ions emitted by the sun in all directions a result of the two million degree temperature of the sun 's outermost layer the corona the solar wind reaches earth with a velocity typically around 400 km s a density of around 5 ions cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2 5 nt for comparison earth 's surface field is typically 30000 50000 nt during magnetic storms in particular flows can be several times faster the interplanetary magnetic field imf may also be much stronger joan feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity her work resulted from data collected by the explorer 33 spacecraft the solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma ionized gas which conducts electricity it is well known since michael faraday 's work around 1830 that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across or is cut by rather than along the lines of the magnetic field an electric current is induced within the conductor the strength of the current depends on a the rate of relative motion b the strength of the magnetic field c the number of conductors ganged together and d the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion dynamos make use of this basic process the dynamo effect any and all conductors solid or otherwise are so affected including plasmas and other fluids the imf originates on the sun linked to the sunspots and its field lines lines of force are dragged out by the solar wind that alone would tend to line them up in the sun earth direction but the rotation of the sun angles them at earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane known as the parker spiral the field lines passing earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge limb of the visible sun at any time the solar wind and the magnetosphere being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind however this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines but less readily perpendicular to them energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection as already mentioned it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind magnetosphere earth 's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the earth 's magnetic field this forms an obstacle to the flow diverting it at an average distance of about 70000 km 11 earth radii or re producing a bow shock 12000 km to 15000 km 1 9 to 2 4 re further upstream the width of the magnetosphere abreast of earth is typically 190000 km 30 re and on the night side a long magnetotail of stretched field lines extends to great distances 200 re the high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the earth the flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence density and speed in the solar wind this flow is favoured by a southward component of the imf which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines the flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the earth around the earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day side in addition to moving perpendicular to the earth 's magnetic field some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the earth 's magnetic field lines gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones the cusps of the magnetosphere separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere producing an auroral glow on 26 february 2008 themis probes were able to determine for the first time the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms two of the five probes positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes it is not well understood but geomagnetic storms may vary with earth 's seasons two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and earth s axis to the ecliptic plane as the earth orbits throughout a year it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field imf from different latitudes of the sun which is tilted at 8 degrees similarly the 23 degree tilt of the earth s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident imf throughout a year these factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the imf links to the magnetosphere in turn this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the earth 's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras auroral particle acceleration the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere in contrast static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature the electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation the increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the earth creates a magnetic mirror that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons the bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector this greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere and thereby the rates of ionisation excitation and consequent emission of auroral light acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere one early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static or quasi static electric field creating a uni directional potential drop no mention is provided of either the necessary space charge or equi potential distribution and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible fundamentally poisson s equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop inexplicably though some authors still invoke quasi static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact in another example there is little justification given for saying fast observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration another theory is based on acceleration by landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region this process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world and appears well able to account in principle for most if not all detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras above below and within the acceleration region other mechanisms have also been proposed in particular alfv n waves wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by hannes alfv n 1942 which have been observed in the laboratory and in space the question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process however because this approach does not point out a different energy source and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of alfv n waves other processes are also involved in the aurora and much remains to be learned auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 kev and are stopped higher up near 200 km such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red on the other hand positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time with energies of 20 30 kev suggesting they might be an overflow along magnetic field lines of the copious ring current ions accelerated at such times by processes different from the ones described above some o ions conics also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora these ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines they therefore start at their mirror points and can travel only upward as they do so the mirror effect transforms their directions of motion from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it which gradually narrows down becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker auroral events of historical significance the auroras that resulted from the great geomagnetic storm on both 28 august and 2 september 1859 are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history in a paper to the royal society on 21 november 1861 balfour stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self recording magnetograph at the kew observatory and established the connection between the 2 september 1859 auroral storm and the carrington hodgson flare event when he observed that it is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act the second auroral event which occurred on 2 september 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense carrington hodgson white light solar flare on 1 september 1859 produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements ship logs and newspapers throughout the united states europe japan and australia it was reported by the new york times that in boston on friday 2 september 1859 the aurora was so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light one o'clock est time on friday 2 september would have been 6 00 gmt and the self recording magnetograph at the kew observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm which was then one hour old at its full intensity between 1859 and 1862 elias loomis published a series of nine papers on the great auroral exhibition of 1859 in the american journal of science where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event that aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history it is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked this insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125000 miles 201000 km of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm some telegraph lines however seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off the following conversation occurred between two operators of the american telegraph line between boston and portland maine on the night of 2 september 1859 and reported in the boston traveler boston operator to portland operator please cut off your battery power source entirely for fifteen minutes portland operator will do so it is now disconnected boston mine is disconnected and we are working with the auroral current how do you receive my writing portland better than with our batteries on current comes and goes gradually boston my current is very strong at times and we can work better without the batteries as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately making current too strong at times for our relay magnets suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble portland very well shall i go ahead with business boston yes go ahead the conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner such events led to the general conclusion that the effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires sometimes it entirely neutralizes them so that in effect no fluid is discoverable in them the aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter resembling in every respect that generated by the electric galvanic battery the currents from it change coming on the wires and then disappear the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith historical theories superstition and mythology an aurora was described by the greek explorer pytheas in the 4th century bc seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his naturales quaestiones classifying them for instance as pithaei 'barrel like' chasmata 'chasm' pogoniae 'bearded' cyparissae 'like cypress trees' and describing their manifold colors he wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds and recalled that under tiberius an aurora formed above the port city of ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army stationed nearby for fire duty galloped to the rescue it has been suggested that pliny the elder depicted the aurora borealis in his natural history when he refers to trabes chasma falling red flames and daylight in the night in the traditions of aboriginal australians the aurora australis is commonly associated with fire for example the gunditjmara people of western victoria called auroras puae buae ashes while the gunai people of eastern victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world the dieri people of south australia say that an auroral display is kootchee an evil spirit creating a large fire similarly the ngarrindjeri people of south australia refer to auroras seen over kangaroo island as the campfires of spirits in the land of the dead aboriginal people in southwest queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the oola pikka ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora bulfinch 's mythology relates that in norse mythology the armour of the valkyrior sheds a strange flickering light which flashes up over the northern skies making what men call the 'aurora borealis' or 'northern lights' there appears to be no evidence in old norse literature to substantiate this assertion the first old norse account of nor rlj s is found in the norwegian chronicle konungs skuggsj from ad 1230 the chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from greenland and he gives three possible explanations that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent walter william bryant wrote in his book kepler 1920 that tycho brahe seems to have been something of a hom opathist for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the aurora borealis in the 1740s benjamin franklin theorized in his paper aurora borealis suppositions and conjectures towards forming an hypothesis for its explanation that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air may not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds which are condens d there and fall in snow which electricity would enter the earth but cannot penetrate the ice may it not i say as a bottle overcharged break thro that low atmosphere and run along in thr vacuum over the air towards the equator diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge strongly visible where densest and becoming less visible as it more diverges till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates or is mingled with the upper air observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the swedish city of uppsala by anders celsius and olof hiorter in 1741 hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead this evidence helped to support their theory that magnetic storms are responsible for such compass fluctuations a variety of native american myths surround the spectacle the european explorer samuel hearne traveled with chipewyan dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the ed thin 'caribou' according to hearne the dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked they believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy during the night after the battle of fredericksburg an aurora was seen from the battlefield the confederate army took this as a sign that god was on their side as the lights were rarely seen so far south the painting aurora borealis by frederic edwin church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the american civil war non terrestrial auroras both jupiter and saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than earth 's jupiter 's equatorial field strength is 4 3 gauss compared to 0 3 gauss for earth and both have extensive radiation belts auroras have been observed on both gas planets most clearly using the hubble space telescope as well as on uranus and neptune the auroras on the gas giants seem like earth 's to be powered by the solar wind in addition however jupiter 's moons especially io are powerful sources of auroras on jupiter these arise from electric currents along field lines field aligned currents generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon io which has active volcanism and an ionosphere is a particularly strong source and its currents also generate radio emissions which have been studied since 1955 using the hubble space telescope auroras over io europa and ganymede have all been observed auroras have also been observed on venus and mars venus has no magnetic field and so venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet a venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night side atmosphere an aurora was detected on mars on 14 august 2004 by the spicam instrument aboard mars express the aurora was located at terra cimmeria in the region of 177 east 52 south the total size of the emission region was about 30 km across and possibly about 8 km high by analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from mars global surveyor scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized this correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of mars the first ever extra solar auroras were discovered in july 2015 over the brown dwarf star lsr j1835 3259 the mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere it has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as yet undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material as is the case with jupiter and its moon io see also aurora heraldry geomagnetic storm heliophysics list of plasma physics articles list of solar storms paschen

the mississippi river on the border with illinois the city has an estimated 2015 population of 315685 and is the cultural and economic center of the greater st louis area home to 2916447 people making it the largest metropolitan area in missouri and the 19th largest in the united states prior to european settlement the area was a major regional center of native american mississippian culture the city of st louis was founded in 1764 by french fur traders pierre lacl de and auguste chouteau and named after louis ix of france the area was ceded to spain following france 's defeat in the seven years' war the area east of the mississippi was ceded to britain in 1800 spanish louisiana was retroceded back to france in 1803 the united states acquired the territory as part of the louisiana purchase after the louisiana purchase st louis developed as a major port on the mississippi river in the late 19th century st louis was ranked as the 4th largest city in the united states it separated from st louis county in 1877 becoming an independent city and limiting its own political boundaries in 1904 it hosted the louisiana purchase exposition and the summer olympics immigration has increased and the city is the center of the largest bosnian population in the world outside their homeland the economy of metro st louis relies on service manufacturing trade transportation of goods and tourism its metro area is home to major corporations including anheuser busch express scripts centene boeing defense emerson energizer panera enterprise peabody energy ameren ralcorp monsanto scottrade edward jones go jet purina and sigma aldrich this city has also become known for its growing medical pharmaceutical and research presence st louis has 2 professional sports teams the st louis cardinals of major league baseball and the st louis blues of the national hockey league the city is commonly identified with the 630 foot 192 m tall gateway arch in downtown st louis history mississippian culture and early exploration the area that would become st louis was a center of the native american mississippian culture which built numerous temple and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the mississippi river their major regional center was at cahokia mounds active from 900 ad to 1500 ad due to numerous major earthworks within st louis boundaries the city was nicknamed as the mound city these mounds were mostly demolished during the city 's development historic native american tribes in the area included the siouan speaking osage people whose territory extended west and the illiniwek european exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673 when french explorers louis jolliet and jacques marquette traveled through the mississippi river valley five years later la salle claimed the region for france as part of la louisiane the earliest european settlements in the area were built in illinois country also known as upper louisiana on the east side of the mississippi river during the 1690s and early 1700s at cahokia kaskaskia and fort de chartres migrants from the french villages on the opposite side of the mississippi river e g kaskaskia founded ste genevieve in the 1730s in early 1764 after france lost the 7 years' war pierre lacl de and his stepson auguste chouteau founded what was to become the city of st louis french lands east of the mississippi had been ceded to great britain and the lands west of the mississippi to spain france and spain were 18th century allies and both were catholic nations the early french families built the city 's economy on the fur trade with the osage as well as with more distant tribes along the missouri river the chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from spain on the fur trade with santa fe french colonists used african slaves as domestic servants and workers in the city from 1762 to 1803 european control of the area west of the mississippi to the northernmost part of the missouri river basin called louisiana was assumed by the spanish as part of the viceroyalty of new spain in 1780 during the american revolutionary war st louis was attacked by british forces mostly native american allies in the battle of st louis city founding french and spanish louisiana period the founding of st louis began in 1763 pierre laclede led an expedition to set up a fur trading post farther up the mississippi river before then laclede had been a very successful merchant for this reason he and his trading partner gilbert antoine de st maxent were offered monopolies for six years of the fur trading in that area though they were originally only granted rights to set up a trading post laclede and other members of his expedition quickly set up a settlement some historians believe that laclede 's determination to create this settlement was the result of his affair with a married woman marie th r se bourgeois chouteau in new orleans laclede on his initial expedition was accompanied by his young stepson auguste chouteau some historians still debate which of the two men was the true founder of st louis the reason for this lingering question is that all the documentation of the founding was loaned and subsequently destroyed in a fire for the first few years of st louis' existence the city was not recognized by any of the governments though originally thought to be under the control of the spanish government no one asserted any authority over the settlement and thus st louis had no local government this led laclede to assume a position of civil control and all problems were disposed in public settings such as conmunal meetings in addition laclede granted new settlers lots in town and the surrounding countryside in hindsight many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as the golden age of st louis by 1765 the city began receiving notifications and visits from representatives and military actives from members of the english french and spanish governments the indians in the local area expressed dissatisfaction to being under the command and control of british forces one of the great ottawa chieftains pontiac was angered by the change of power and potential for the british to come into their lands he desired to fight against them but many of the st louis inhabitants refused st louis was transferred to the french first republic in 1800 although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by spanish officials then sold by the french to the u s in 1803 as part of the louisiana purchase st louis became the capital of and gateway to the new territory shortly after the official transfer of authority was made the lewis and clark expedition was commissioned by president thomas jefferson the expedition departed from st louis in may 1804 along the missouri river to explore the vast territory there were hopes of finding a water route to the pacific ocean but the party had to go overland in the upper west they reached the pacific ocean via the columbia river in summer 1805 they returned reaching st louis on september 23 1806 both lewis and clark lived in st louis after the expedition many other explorers settlers and trappers such as ashley 's hundred would later take a similar route to the west 19th century the city elected its first municipal legislators called trustees in 1808 steamboats first arrived in st louis in 1818 improving connections with new orleans and eastern markets missouri was admitted as a state in 1821 as the state gained settlers the first capital of missouri was st louis before eventually moving to the more central location of jefferson city in 1826 st louis was incorporated as a city in 1822 and continued to develop largely due to its busy port and trade connections slaves worked in many jobs on the waterfront as well as on the riverboats given the city 's location close to the free state of illinois and others some slaves escaped to freedom others especially women with children sued in court in freedom suits and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits about half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the american civil war immigrants from ireland and germany arrived in st louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s and the population of st louis grew from less than 20000 in 1840 to 77860 in 1850 to more than 160000 by 1860 by the mid 1800s st louis had a greater population than new orleans settled by many southerners in a slave state the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the american civil war in 1861 28 civilians were killed in a clash with union troops the war hurt st louis economically due to the union blockade of river traffic to the south on the mississippi river the st louis arsenal constructed ironclads for the union navy after the war st louis profited via trade with the west aided by the 1874 completion of the eads bridge named for its architect industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge the first in the mid west over the mississippi river the bridge connects st louis missouri to east st louis illinois the eads bridge became an iconic image of the city of st louis from the time of its erection until 1965 when the gateway arch bridge was constructed the bridge crosses the st louis riverfront between laclede 's landing to the north and the grounds of the gateway arch to the south today the road deck has been restored allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river the st louis metrolink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993 an estimated 8500 vehicles pass through it daily on august 22 1876 the city of st louis voted to secede from st louis county and become an independent city industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century major corporations such as the anheuser busch brewery and ralston purina company were established st louis also was home to desloge consolidated lead company and several brass era automobile companies including the success automobile manufacturing company st louis is the site of the wainwright building an early skyscraper built in 1892 by noted architect louis sullivan 20th century in 1904 the city hosted the 1904 world 's fair and the 1904 summer olympics becoming the first non european city to host the olympics permanent facilities and structures remaining from the fair are forest park and associated structures within its boundaries the st louis art museum the st louis zoo and the missouri history museum as well as tower grove park and the botanical gardens in the aftermath of emancipation of slaves following the civil war social and racial discrimination in housing and employment were common in st louis starting in the 1910s many property deeds included racial or religious restrictive covenants against new immigrants and migrants in the first half of the 20th century st louis was a destination for many african americans in the great migration from the rural south seeking better opportunities during world war ii the naacp campaigned to integrate war factories and restrictive covenants were prohibited in 1948 by the shelley v kraemer u s supreme court decision which case originated as a lawsuit in st louis in 1964 civil rights activists protested at the construction of the gateway arch to publicize their effort to gain entry for african americans into the skilled trade unions where they were underrepresented the department of justice filed the first suit against the unions under the civil rights act of 1964 in the first part of the century st louis had some of the worst air pollution in the united states in april 1940 the city banned the use of soft coal mined in nearby states the city hired inspectors to ensure only hard anthracite was burned by 1946 the city had reduced air pollution by about three quarters de jure educational segregation continued into the 1950s and de facto segregation continued into the 1970s leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement students have been bussed mostly from the city to county school districts to have opportunities for integrated classes although the city has created magnet schools to attract students st louis like many midwestern cities expanded in the early 20th century due to industrialization which provided jobs to new generations of immigrants and migrants from the south it reached its peak population of 856796 at the 1950 census suburbanization from the 1950s through the 1990s dramatically reduced the city 's population as did restructuring of industry and loss of jobs the effects of suburbanization were exacerbated by the relatively small geographical size of st louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city and it lost much of its tax base during the 19th and 20th century most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city however st louis was unable to do so in the 21st century the city of st louis contains only 11 of its total metropolitan population while among the top 20 metro areas in the united states the central cities contain an average of 24 of total metropolitan area population although small increases in population have taken place in st louis during the early 2000s overall the city lost population from 2000 to 2010 immigration has continued with the city attracting vietnamese latinos from mexico and central america and bosnians the latter forming the largest bosnian community outside of bosnia several urban renewal projects were built in the 1950s as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems of which pruitt igoe became a symbol of failure it was torn down since the 1980s several revitalization efforts have focused on downtown st louis 21st century urban revitalization continued in the new century gentrification has taken place in the washington avenue historic district in 2006 st louis received the world leadership award for urban renewal in 2013 the us census bureau estimate that st louis had a population of 318416 in 2014 st louis celebrated its 250th birthday with events throughout the year these were coordinated by the missouri history museum through its nonprofit entity stl250 with help from the st louis ambassadors volunteer organization and its u s small business institute commemorations of the arch 's 50th birthday took place in 2015 geography cityscape landmarks architecture the architecture of st louis exhibits a variety of commercial residential and monumental architecture st louis is known for the gateway arch the tallest monument constructed in the united states at 630 feet 190 m the arch pays homage to thomas jefferson and st louis' position as the gateway to the west architectural influences reflected in the area include french colonial german early american and modern architectural styles some notable post modern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s including the one us bank plaza 1976 the at t center 1986 and one metropolitan square 1989 which is the tallest building in st louis one us bank plaza the local headquarters for us bancorp was constructed for the mercantile bancorporation in the structural expressionist style emphasizing the steel structure of the building during the 1990s st louis saw the construction of the largest united states courthouse by area the thomas f eagleton united states courthouse completed in 2000 the eagleton courthouse is home to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri and the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit the most recent high rise buildings in st louis include two residential towers the park east tower in the central west end and the roberts tower located in downtown several examples of religious structures are extant from the pre civil war period and most reflect the common residential styles of the time among the earliest is the basilica of st louis king of france locally referred to as the old cathedral the basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the federal style other religious buildings from the period include ss cyril and methodius church 1857 in the romanesque revival style and christ church cathedral completed in 1867 designed in 1859 in the gothic revival style only a few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century the original st louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a federal style stone facade with a rounded portico however this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s the old st louis county courthouse locally known as the old courthouse was completed in 1864 and was notable for having an early cast iron dome and for being the tallest structure in missouri until 1894 finally a customs house was constructed in the greek revival style in 1852 but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the u s customhouse and post office because much of the city 's early commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront many pre civil war buildings were demolished during construction of the gateway arch the city 's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast iron warehouses called laclede 's landing now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs the district is located north of gateway arch along the riverfront other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the anheuser busch brewery which date to the early 1860s st louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century the largest and most ornate of these is the cathedral basilica of st louis designed by thomas p barnett and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the neo byzantine style the st louis cathedral as it is known has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world another landmark in religious architecture of st louis is the st stanislaus kostka which is an example of the polish cathedral style among the other major designs of the period were st alphonsus liguori locally known as the rock church 1867 in the gothic revival and second presbyterian church of st louis 1900 in richardsonian romanesque by the 1900 census st louis was the fourth largest city in the country in 1904 the city hosted a world 's fair at forest park called the louisiana purchase exposition its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered among the fair related cultural institutions in the park are the st louis art museum designed by cass gilbert part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of art hill and the flight cage at the st louis zoo the missouri history museum was built afterward with the profit from the fair but 1904 left other assets to the city like theodore link 's 1894 st louis union station and an improved forest park neighborhoods the city is divided into 79 government designated neighborhoods the neighborhood divisions have no legal standing although some neighborhood associations administer grants or hold veto power over historic district development several neighborhoods are lumped together in categories such as north city and south city the following is a list of neighborhoods of the city of st louis missouri topography according to the united states census bureau st louis has a total area of 66 square miles 170 km2 of which 62 square miles 160 km2 is land and 4 1 square miles 11 km2 6 2 is water not shown on simple maps of the city the land at its airport is owned by the city served by its fire department and others and is an exclave of st louis the city is built primarily on bluffs and terraces that rise 100 200 feet above the western banks of the mississippi river in the midwestern united states just south of the missouri mississippi confluence much of the area is a fertile and gently rolling prairie that features low hills and broad shallow valleys both the mississippi river and the missouri river have cut large valleys with wide flood plains limestone and dolomite of the mississippian epoch underlie the area and parts of the city are karst in nature this is particularly true of the area south of downtown which has numerous sinkholes and caves most of the caves in the city have been sealed but many springs are visible along the riverfront coal brick clay and millerite ore were once mined in the city the predominant surface rock known as st louis limestone is used as dimension stone and rubble for construction near the southern boundary of the city of st louis separating it from st louis county is the river des peres practically the only river or stream within the city limits that is not entirely underground most of river des peres was confined to a channel or put underground in the 1920s and early 1930s the lower section of the river was the site of some of the worst flooding of the great flood of 1993 the city 's eastern boundary is the mississippi river which separates missouri from illinois the missouri river forms the northern line of st louis county except for a few areas where the river has changed its course the meramec river forms most of its southern line climate st louis lies in the transitional zone between the humid continental climate type and the humid subtropical climate type k ppen dfa and cfa respectively with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature the city experiences hot humid summers and chilly to cold winters it is subject to both cold arctic air and hot humid tropical air from the gulf of mexico the average annual temperature recorded at nearby lambert st louis international airport is 57 1 f 13 9 c both 100 and 0 f 38 and 18 c temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year average annual precipitation is about 41 0 inches 1040 mm but annual precipitation has ranged from 20 59 in 523 mm in 1953 to 61 24 in 1555 mm in 2015 st louis experiences thunderstorms 48 days a year on average especially in the spring these storms can often be severe with high winds large hail and tornadoes lying within the hotbed of tornado alley st louis reigns as one of the most frequently tornadic metropolitan areas and has an extensive history of particularly damaging tornadoes severe flooding such as the great flood of 1993 may occur in spring and summer the often rapid melting of thick snow cover upstream either the missouri or mississippi rivers can contribute to springtime flooding flora and fauna before the founding of the city the area was mostly prairie and open forest native americans maintained this environment good for hunting by burning underbrush trees are mainly oak maple and hickory similar to the forests of the nearby ozarks common understory trees include eastern redbud serviceberry and flowering dogwood riparian areas are forested with mainly american sycamore most of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees the largest native forest area is found in forest park in autumn the changing color of the trees is notable most species here are typical of the eastern woodland although numerous decorative non native species are found the most notable invasive species is japanese honeysuckle which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees it is removed from some parks large mammals found in the city include urbanized coyotes and white tailed deer eastern gray squirrel cottontail rabbit and other rodents are abundant as well as the nocturnal virginia opossum large bird species are abundant in parks and include canada goose mallard duck as well as shorebirds including the great egret and great blue heron gulls are common along the mississippi river these species typically follow barge traffic winter populations of bald eagles are found along the mississippi river around the chain of rocks bridge the city is on the mississippi flyway used by migrating birds and has a large variety of small bird species common to the eastern us the eurasian tree sparrow an introduced species is limited in north america to the counties surrounding st louis the city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species including tower grove park frogs are commonly found in the springtime especially after extensive wet periods common species include the american toad and species of chorus frogs commonly called spring peepers which are found in nearly every pond some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs mosquitoes no see ums and houseflies are common insect nuisances especially in july and august because of this windows are nearly universally fitted with screens invasive populations of honeybees have sharply declined in recent years numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche and armadillos have been regularly seen throughout the st louis area especially since 2005 demographics st louis grew slowly until the american civil war when industrialization and immigration sparked a boom mid 19th century immigrants included many irish and germans later there were immigrants from southern and eastern europe in the early 20th century african american and white migrants came from the south the former as part of the great migration out of rural areas of the deep south many came from mississippi and arkansas after years of immigration migration and expansion the city reached its peak population in 1950 that year the census bureau reported st louis' population as 82 white and 17 9 african american after world war ii st louis began losing population to the suburbs first because of increased demand for new housing unhappiness with city services ease of commuting by subsidized highways and later white flight st louis' population decline has resulted in a significant increase of abandoned residential housing units and vacant lots throughout the city proper this blight has attracted much wildlife such as deer and coyotes to the many abandoned overgrown lots st louis has lost 62 7 of its population since the 1950 united states census the highest percent of any city that had a population of 100000 or more at the time of the 1950 census detroit michigan and youngstown ohio are the only other cities that have had population declines of at least 60 in the same time frame the population of the city of st louis has been in decline since the 1960 census during this period the population of the st louis metropolitan area which includes more than one county has grown every year and continues to do so a big factor in the decline has been the rapid increase in suburbanization according to the 2010 united states census st louis had 319294 people living in 142057 households of which 67488 households were families the population density was 5158 2 people per square mile 1990 6 km about 24 of the population was 19 or younger 9 were 20 to 24 31 were 25 to 44 25 were 45 to 64 and 11 were 65 or older the median age was about 34 years the population was about 49 2 african american 43 9 white 42 2 non hispanic white 2

side of the city the area north of delmar boulevard is 94 0 black compared with 35 0 in the central corridor and 26 0 in the south side of st louis among the asian american population in the city the largest ethnic group is vietnamese 0 9 followed by chinese 0 6 and asian indians 0 5 the vietnamese community has concentrated in the dutchtown neighborhood of south st louis chinese are concentrated in the central west end people of mexican descent are the largest latino group and make up 2 2 of st louis' population they have the highest concentration in the dutchtown benton park west cherokee

any context or averaging the lone monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to u s steel 's clairton coke works the nation 's largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the city 's jurisdiction of pollution controls leading to possible confusion that pittsburgh itself is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey the region 's readings also reflect

substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009 and just 10 between 2008 and 2010 compared to more than 40

communities and almost all of chugach state park anchorage international airport is a common refueling stop for many international flights and is home to a major fedex hub which the company calls a critical part of its global network of services anchorage has been named an all america city four times in 1956 1965 1984 85 and 2002 by the national civic league it has also been named by kiplinger as the most tax friendly city in the united states history russian presence in south central alaska was well established in the 19th century in 1867 u s secretary of state william h seward brokered a deal to purchase alaska from imperial russia for 7 2 million about two cents an acre his political rivals lampooned the deal as seward 's folly seward 's icebox and walrussia by 1888 gold was discovered along turnagain arm alaska became a united states territory in 1912 anchorage unlike every other large town in alaska south of the brooks range was neither a fishing nor mining camp the area surrounding anchorage lacks significant economic metal minerals a number of dena'ina settlements existed along knik arm for years by 1911 the families of j d bud whitney and jim st clair lived at the mouth of ship creek and were joined there by a young forest ranger jack brown and his bride nellie in 1912 to have lived in the ship creek valley in the 1910s prior to the large influx of settlers the city grew from its happenstance choice as the site in 1914 under the direction of frederick mears of a railroad construction port for the alaska engineering commission the area near the mouth of ship creek where the railroad headquarters was located quickly became a tent city a town site was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city greatly noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other alaska town sites in 1915 territorial governor john franklin alexander strong encouraged residents to change the city 's name to one that had more significance and local associations in the summer of that year residents held a vote to change the city 's name a plurality of residents favored changing the city 's name to alaska city however the territorial government ultimately declined to change the city 's name anchorage was incorporated on november 23 1920 construction of the alaska railroad continued until its completion in 1923 the city 's economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad col otto f ohlson the swedish born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades became a symbol of residents' contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroad 's affairs which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in alaska between the 1930s and the 1950s the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military became increasingly important aviation operations in anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town today 's delaney park strip which residents also used as a golf course an increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929 this became merrill field which served as anchorage 's primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s until anchorage international airport replaced it in 1951 however merrill field still sees a significant amount of general aviation traffic elmendorf air force base and fort richardson were constructed in the 1940s and served as the city 's primary economic engine until the 1968 prudhoe bay discovery shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry the 2005 base realignment and closure process led to the combining of the two bases along with kulis air national guard base to form joint base elmendorf richardson on march 27 1964 the magnitude 9 2 good friday earthquake hit anchorage killing 115 people and causing 311 million 2 4 billion current value in damage the earth shaking event lasted nearly five minutes most structures that failed remained intact for the first few minutes then failed with repeated flexing it was the world 's second largest earthquake in recorded history rebuilding dominated the remainder of the 1960s in 1968 arco discovered oil in prudhoe bay on the alaska north slope and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in anchorage in 1975 the city of anchorage and the greater anchorage area borough which includes eagle river girdwood glen alps and several other communities merged into the geographically larger municipality of anchorage the city continued to grow in the 1980s and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place several attempts have been made to move alaska 's state capital from juneau to anchorage or to a site closer to anchorage the motivation is straightforward the railbelt between anchorage and fairbanks contains the majority of the state 's population robert atwood owner of the anchorage times and a tireless booster for the city championed the move alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962 but in 1974 as alaska 's center of population moved away from southeast alaska and to the railbelt voters approved the move communities such as fairbanks and much of rural alaska opposed moving the capital to anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the state 's largest city as a result in 1976 voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near willow about 70 miles 110 km north of anchorage opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat in the 1978 elections a nearly 1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities subsequent attempts to move the capital or the legislature to wasilla north of anchorage also failed anchorage contains over twice as many state employees as juneau and is to a considerable extent the center of state and federal government activity in alaska geography anchorage is located in southcentral alaska at 61 degrees north it lies slightly

which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of chugach state park the city 's sea coast consists mostly of treacherous mudflats newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial silt unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud the two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988 according to the united states census bureau the municipality has a total area of 1961 1 square miles 5079 2 km2 1697 2 square miles 4395 8 km2 of which is land and

daylight hours to be very short the city is often cloudy during the winter which further decreases the amount of sunlight experienced by residents due to its proximity to active volcanoes ash hazards are a significant though infrequent occurrence the most recent notable volcanic activity centered on the multiple eruptions of mount redoubt during march april 2009 resulting in a 25000 foot 7600 m high ash cloud as well as ash accumulation throughout the cook inlet region previously the most active recent event was an august 1992 eruption of mount spurr which is located 78 miles 126 km west of

member city council whose members are elected at large prior to 1924 city council members were elected through a system of wards the ward system was subject to corruption and as with any one party dominance abuses arose from the 1880s to the 1920s the republican party dominated city politics with the political machine of boss cox exerting control a reform movement arose in 1923 led by another republican murray seasongood seasongood founded the charter committee which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at large system they gained approval by voters for a council manager government form of government in which the smaller council compared to the number of previous ward representatives hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city from 1924 to 1957 the council was elected by proportional representation and single transfer voting stv starting with ashtabula in 1915 several major cities in ohio adopted this electoral system which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power for that reason such groups opposed it in an effort to overturn the charter that provided for pr opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power at a time of increasing civil rights activism the pr stv system had enabled minorities to enter local politics and gain seats on the city council more than they had before in proportion to their share of the population this made the government more representative of the residents of the city overturning that charter in 1957 all candidates had to run in a single race for the nine city council positions the top nine vote getters were elected the 9 x system which favored candidates who could appeal to the entire geographic area of the city and reach its residents with campaign materials the mayor was elected by the council in 1977 thirty three year old jerry springer later a notable television talk show host was chosen to serve one year as mayor residents continued to work to improve their system to have their votes count more starting in 1987 the top vote getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor starting in

cincinnati subway the subway was planned to be a 16 mile loop from downtown to norwood to oakley and back to the east side of downtown world war i delayed the construction in 1920 and inflation raised

as saint paul and also known by his native name saul of tarsus hebrew translit sha'ul ha tarsi greek translit saulos tarseus was an apostle though not one of the twelve apostles who taught the gospel of the christ to the first century world he is generally considered one of the most important figures of the apostolic age in the mid 30s to the mid 50s ad he founded several churches in asia minor and europe paul took advantage of his status as both a jew and a roman citizen to minister to both jewish and roman audiences according to writings in the new testament paul was dedicated to the persecution of the early disciples of jesus in the area of jerusalem in the narrative of the acts of the apostles often referred to simply as acts paul was traveling on the road from jerusalem to damascus on a mission to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem when the resurrected jesus appeared to him in a great light he was struck blind but after three days his sight was restored by ananias of damascus and paul began to preach that jesus of nazareth is the jewish messiah and the son of god approximately half of the book of acts deals with paul 's life and works fourteen of the twenty seven books in the new testament have traditionally been attributed to paul seven of the epistles are undisputed by scholars as being authentic with varying degrees of argument about the remainder pauline authorship of the epistle to the hebrews is not asserted in the epistle itself and was already doubted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries it was almost unquestioningly accepted from the 5th to the 16th centuries that paul was the author of hebrews but that view is now almost universally rejected by scholars the other six are believed by some scholars to have come from followers writing in his name using material from paul 's surviving letters and letters written by him that no longer survive other scholars argue that the idea of a pseudonymous author for the disputed epistles raises many problems today paul 's epistles continue to be vital roots of the theology worship and pastoral life in the catholic and protestant traditions of the west and the orthodox traditions of the east paul 's influence on christian thought and practice has been characterized as being as profound as it is pervasive among that of many other apostles and missionaries involved in the spread of the christian faith augustine of hippo developed paul 's idea that salvation is based on faith and not works of the law martin luther 's interpretation of paul 's writings influenced luther 's doctrine of sola fide available sources the main source for information about paul 's life is the material found in his epistles and in acts however the epistles contain little information about paul 's past the book of acts recounts more information but leaves several parts of paul 's life out of its narrative such as his probable but undocumented execution in rome some scholars believe acts also contradicts paul 's epistles on multiple accounts in particular concerning the frequency of paul 's visits to the church in jerusalem sources outside the new testament that mention paul include clement of rome 's epistle to the corinthians late 1st early 2nd century ignatius of antioch 's letter to the romans early 2nd century polycarp 's letter to the philippians early 2nd century the 2nd century document martyrdom of polycarp names it has been popularly assumed that saul 's name was changed when he converted from judaism to christianity but that is not the case his jewish name was saul hebrew modern sha'ul tiberian l asked for prayed for borrowed perhaps after the biblical king saul a fellow benjamite and the first king of israel according to the book of acts he inherited roman citizenship from his father as a roman citizen he also bore the latin name of paul in biblical greek paulos and in latin paulus acts 16 37 22 25 28 it was quite usual for the jews of that time to have two names one hebrew the other latin or greek jesus called him saul saul in the hebrew tongue in the book of acts when he had the vision which led to his conversion on the road to damascus later in a vision to ananias of damascus the lord referred to him as saul of tarsus when ananias came to restore his sight he called him brother saul in acts 13 9 saul is called paul for the first time on the island of cyprus much later than the time of his conversion the author luke indicates that the names were interchangeable saul who also is called paul he thereafter refers to him as paul apparently paul 's preference since he is called paul in all other bible books where he is mentioned including those that he authored adopting his roman name was typical of paul 's missionary style his method was to put people at their ease and to approach them with his message in a language and style to which they could relate as in 1 cor 9 19 23 biblical narrative early life the two main sources of information by which we have access to the earliest segments of paul 's career are the bible 's book of acts and the autobiographical elements of paul 's letters to the early church communities paul was likely born between the years of 5 bc and 5 ad the book of acts indicates that paul was a roman citizen by birth more affirmatively describing his father as such but some scholars have taken issue with the evidence presented by the text acts 16 37 acts 22 25 29 he was from a devout jewish family in the city of tarsus one of the largest trade centers on the mediterranean coast it had been in existence several hundred years prior to his birth it was renowned for its university during the time of alexander the great who died in 323 bc tarsus was the most influential city in asia minor paul referred to himself as being of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee phil 3 5 the bible reveals very little about paul 's family paul 's nephew his sister 's son is mentioned in acts 23 16 acts also quotes paul referring to his father by saying he paul was a pharisee the son of a pharisee acts 23 6 paul refers to his mother in romans 16 13 as among those at rome in romans 16 7 he states that his relatives andronicus and junia were christians before he was and were prominent among the apostles the family had a history of religious piety 2 timothy 1 3 apparently the family lineage had been very attached to pharisaic traditions and observances for generations philippians 3 5 6 acts says that he was in the tent making profession acts 18 1 3 this was to become an initial connection with priscilla and aquila with whom he would partner in tentmaking acts 18 3 and later become very important teammates as fellow missionaries rom 16 4 while he was still fairly young he was sent to jerusalem to receive his education at the school of gamaliel acts 22 3 one of the most noted rabbis in history the hillel school was noted for giving its students a balanced education likely giving paul broad exposure to classical literature philosophy and ethics some of his family may have resided in jerusalem since later the son of one of his sisters saved his life there acts 23 16 nothing more is known of his background until he takes an active part in the martyrdom of stephen acts 7 58 60 22 20 paul confesses that beyond measure he persecuted the church of god prior to his conversion gal 1 13 14 phil 3 6 acts 8 1 3 although we know from his biography and from acts that paul could speak hebrew modern scholarship suggests that koine greek was his first language in his letters paul drew heavily on his knowledge of stoic philosophy using stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new gentile converts in their understanding of the revealed word of god he also owed much to his training in the law and the prophets utilizing this knowledge to convince his jewish countrymen of the unity of past old testament prophecy and covenants with the fulfilling of these in jesus christ his wide spectrum of experiences and education gave the apostle to the gentiles rom 1 5 11 13 gal 2 8 the tools which he later would use to effectively spread the gospel and to establish the church in the roman empire conversion paul 's conversion can be dated to 31 36 by his reference to it in one of his letters in galatians 1 16 paul writes that god was pleased to reveal his son to me in 1 corinthians 15 8 as he lists the order in which jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection paul writes last of all as to one untimely born he appeared to me also according to the account in acts it took place on the road to damascus where he reported having experienced a vision of the resurrected jesus the account says that he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me saul replied who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks acts 9 4 5 according to the account in acts 9 1 22 he was blinded for three days and had to be led into damascus by the hand during these three days saul took no food or water and spent his time in prayer to god when ananias of damascus arrived he laid his hands on him and said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost acts 9 17 his sight was restored he got up and was baptized acts 9 18 this story occurs only in acts not in the pauline epistles the author of acts of the apostles may have learned of paul 's conversion from the church in jerusalem or from the church in antioch or possibly from paul himself post conversion and immediately he proclaimed jesus in the synagogues saying he is the son of god and all who heard him were amazed and said is not this the man who made havoc in jerusalem of those who called upon this name and has he not come here for this purpose to bring them bound before the chief priests but saul increased all the more in strength and confounded the jews who lived in damascus by proving that jesus was the christ in the opening verses of romans 1 paul provides a litany of his own apostolic appointment to preach among the gentiles gal 1 16 and his post conversion convictions about the risen christ paul described himself as a servant of jesus christ having experienced an unforeseen sudden startling change due to all powerful grace not the fruit of his reasoning or thoughts gal 1 12 15 1 cor 15 10 having seen christ as did the other apostles when christ appeared to him 1 cor 15 8 as he appeared to peter to james to the twelve after his resurrection 1 cor 9 1 called to be an apostle set apart for the gospel of god paul described jesus as having been promised by god beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures being the true messiah and the son of god having biological lineage from david according to the flesh rom 1 3 having been declared to be the son of god in power according to the spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead being jesus christ our lord the one through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations including you who are called to belong to jesus christ jesus lives in heaven is god 's son would soon return the cross he now believed jesus' death was a voluntary sacrifice that reconciled sinners with god rom 5 6 10 phil 2 8 the law he now believed the law only reveals the extent of people 's enslavement to the power of sin a power that must be broken by christ rom 3 20b 7 7 12 gentiles he had believed gentiles were outside the covenant that god made with israel he now believed gentiles and jews were united as the people of god in christ jesus gal 3 28 circumcision had believed circumcision was the rite through which males became part of israel an exclusive community of god 's chosen people phil 3 3 5 he now believed that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything but that the new creation is what counts in the sight of god gal 6 15 and that this new creation is a work of christ in the life of believers making them part of the church an inclusive community of jews and gentiles reconciled with god through faith rom 6 4 persecution had believed his violent persecution of the church to be an indication of his zeal for his religion phil 3 6 he now believed jewish hostility toward the church was sinful opposition that would incur god 's wrath 1 thess 2 14 16 he believed he was halted by christ when his fury was at its height acts 9 1 2 it was through zeal that he persecuted the church philippians 3 6 and he obtained mercy because he had acted ignorantly in unbelief 1 tim 1 13 the last days had believed god 's messiah would put an end to the old age of evil and initiate a new age of righteousness he now believed this would happen in stages that had begun with the resurrection of jesus but the old age would continue until jesus returns rom 16 25 1 cor 10 11 gal 1 4 paul is critical both theologically and empirically of claims of moral or lineal superiority rom 2 16 26 of jews while conversely strongly sustaining the notion of a special place for the children of israel 9 11 there are debates as to whether paul understood himself as commissioned to take the gospel to the gentiles at the moment of his conversion early ministry after his conversion paul went to damascus where acts 9 states he was healed of his blindness and baptized by ananias of damascus paul says that it was in damascus that he barely escaped death 2 cor 11 32 paul also says that he then went first to arabia and then came back to damascus gal 1 17 paul 's trip to arabia is not mentioned anywhere else in the bible and some suppose he actually traveled to mount sinai for meditations in the desert he describes in galatians how three years after his conversion he went to jerusalem there he met james and stayed with simon peter for 15 days gal 1 13 24 paul located mount sinai in arabia in galatians 4 24 25 paul asserted that he received the gospel not from man but directly by the revelation of jesus christ gal 1 11 16 he claimed almost total independence from the jerusalem community possibly in the cenacle but agreed with it on the nature and content of the gospel gal 1 22 24 he appeared eager to bring material support to jerusalem from the various growing gentile churches that he started in his writings paul used the persecutions he endured to avow proximity and union with jesus and as a validation of his teaching paul 's narrative in galatians states that 14 years after his conversion he went again to jerusalem gal 2 1 10 it is not known what happened during this time but both acts and galatians provide some details at the end of this time barnabas went to find paul and brought him back to antioch acts 11 26 when a famine occurred in judea around 45 46 paul and barnabas journeyed to jerusalem to deliver financial support from the antioch community according to acts antioch had become an alternative center for christians following the dispersion of the believers after the death of stephen it was in antioch that the followers of jesus were first called christians acts 11 26 first missionary journey the author of acts arranges paul 's travels into three separate journeys the first journey acts 13 14 led initially by barnabas took paul from antioch to cyprus then into southern asia minor anatolia and finally returning to antioch in cyprus paul rebukes and blinds elymas the magician acts 13 8 12 who was criticizing their teachings from this point on paul is described as the leader of the group they sail to perga in pamphylia john mark leaves them and returns to jerusalem paul and barnabas go on to pisidian antioch on sabbath they go to the synagogue the leaders invite them to speak paul reviews israelite history from life in egypt to king david he introduces jesus as a descendant of david brought to israel by god he said that his team came to town to bring the message of salvation he recounts the story of jesus' death and resurrection he quotes from the septuagint to assert that jesus was the promised christos who brought them forgiveness for their sins both the jews and the god fearing gentiles invited them to talk more next sabbath at that time almost the whole city gathered this upset some influential jews who spoke against them paul used the occasion to announce a change in his mission which from then on would be to the gentiles acts 13 13 48 interval at antioch antioch served as a major christian center for paul 's evangelism and he remained there for a long time with the disciples at the conclusion of his first journey the exact duration of paul 's stay in antioch is unknown with estimates ranging from nine months to as long as eight years council of jerusalem a vital meeting between paul and the jerusalem church took place some time in the years 50 51 described in acts 15 2 and usually seen as the same event mentioned by paul in galatians 2 1 the key question raised was whether gentile converts needed to be circumcised at this meeting paul states in his letter to the galatians that peter james and john accepted paul 's mission to the gentiles the jerusalem meetings are mentioned in acts and also in paul 's letters for example the jerusalem visit for famine relief acts 11 27 30 apparently corresponds to the first visit to peter and james only gal 1 18 20 f f bruce suggested that the fourteen years could be from paul 's conversion rather than from his first visit to jerusalem incident at antioch despite the agreement achieved at the council of jerusalem paul recounts how he later publicly confronted peter in a dispute sometimes called the incident at antioch over peter 's reluctance to share a meal with gentile christians in antioch because they did not strictly adhere to jewish customs writing later of the incident paul recounts i opposed peter to his face because he was clearly in the wrong and says he told peter you are a jew yet you live like a gentile and not like a jew how is it then that you force gentiles to follow jewish customs gal 2 11 14 paul also mentions that even barnabas his traveling companion and fellow apostle until that time sided with peter the final outcome of the incident remains uncertain the catholic encyclopedia suggests that paul won the argument because paul 's account of the incident leaves no doubt that peter saw the justice of the rebuke however paul himself never mentions a victory and l michael white 's from jesus to christianity draws the opposite conclusion the blowup with peter was a total failure of political bravado and paul soon left antioch as persona non grata never again to return the primary source account of the incident at antioch is paul 's letter to the galatians gal 2 11 14 second missionary journey paul left for his second missionary journey from jerusalem in late autumn 49 after the meeting of the council of jerusalem where the circumcision question was debated on their trip around the mediterranean sea paul and his companion barnabas stopped in antioch where they had a sharp argument about taking john mark with them on their trips the book of acts said that john mark had left them in a previous trip and gone home unable to resolve the dispute paul and barnabas decided to separate barnabas took john mark with him while silas joined paul paul and silas initially visited tarsus paul 's birthplace derbe and lystra in lystra they met timothy a disciple who was spoken well of and decided to take him with them the church kept growing adding believers and strengthening in faith daily acts 16 5 in philippi paul cast a spirit of divination out of a servant girl whose masters were then unhappy about the loss of income her soothsaying provided acts 16 16 24 they turned the city against the missionaries and paul and silas were put in jail after a miraculous earthquake the gates of the prison fell apart and paul and silas could have escaped but remained this event led to the conversion of the jailor acts 16 25 40 they continued traveling going by berea and then to athens where paul preached to the jews and god fearing greeks in the synagogue and to the greek intellectuals in the areopagus paul continued from athens to corinth interval in corinth around 50 52 paul spent 18 months in corinth the reference in acts to proconsul gallio helps ascertain this date cf gallio inscription in corinth paul met priscilla and aquila acts 18 2 who became faithful believers and helped paul through his other missionary journeys the couple followed paul and his companions to ephesus and stayed there to start one of the strongest and most faithful churches at that time acts 18 18 21 in 52 departing from corinth paul stopped at the nearby village of cenchreae to have his hair cut off because of a vow he had earlier taken it is possible this was to be a final haircut prior to fulfilling his vow to become a nazirite for a defined period of time with priscilla and aquila the missionaries then sailed to ephesus and then paul alone went on to caesarea to greet the church there he then traveled north to antioch where he stayed for some time greek perhaps about a year before leaving again on a third missionary journey some new testament texts suggest that he also visited jerusalem during this period for one of the jewish feasts possibly pentecost textual critic henry alford and others consider the reference to a jerusalem visit to be genuine and it accords with acts 21 29 according to which paul and trophimus the ephesian had previously been seen in jerusalem third missionary journey according to acts paul began his third missionary journey by travelling all around the region of galatia and phrygia to strengthen teach and rebuke the believers paul then traveled to ephesus an important center of early christianity and stayed there for almost three years probably working there as a tentmaker as he had done when he stayed in corinth he is claimed to have performed numerous miracles healing people and casting out demons and he apparently organized missionary activity in other regions paul left ephesus after an attack from a local silversmith resulted in a pro artemis riot involving most of the city during his stay in ephesus paul wrote four letters to the church in corinth paul went through macedonia into achaea acts 20 1 2 and stayed in greece probably corinth for three months acts 20 1 2 during 56 57 ad commentators generally agree that paul dictated his epistle to the romans during this period he then made ready to continue on to syria but he changed his plans and traveled back through macedonia because of some jews who had made a plot against him in romans 15 19 paul wrote that he visited illyricum but he may have meant what would now be called illyria graeca which was at that time a division of the roman province of macedonia on their way back to jerusalem paul and his companions visited other cities such as philippi troas miletus rhodes and tyre paul finished his trip with a stop in caesarea where he and his companions stayed with philip the evangelist before finally arriving at jerusalem acts 21 8 10 21 15 journey from rome to spain among the writings of the early christians pope clement i said that paul was herald of the gospel of christ in the west and that he had gone to the extremity of the west john chrysostom indicated that paul preached in spain for after he had been in rome he returned to spain but whether he came thence again into these parts we know not cyril of jerusalem said that paul fully preached the gospel and instructed even imperial rome and carried the earnestness of his preaching as far as spain undergoing conflicts innumerable and performing signs and wonders the muratorian fragment mentions the departure of paul from the city of rome 5a 39 when he journeyed to spain visits to jerusalem in acts and the epistles this table is adapted from white from jesus to christianity note that the matching of paul 's travels in the acts and the travels in his epistles is done for the reader 's convenience and is not approved of by all scholars last visit to jerusalem and arrest in 57 upon completion of his third missionary journey paul arrived in jerusalem for his fifth and final visit with a collection of money for the local community acts reports that he initially was warmly received however acts goes on to recount how paul was warned by james and the elders that he was gaining a reputation for being against the law saying they have been told about you that you teach all the jews who are among the gentiles to forsake moses telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs paul underwent a purification ritual in order to give the jews no grounds to bring accusations against him for not following their law acts 21 17 26 after seven days in jerusalem some jews from asia most likely from roman asia accused paul of defiling the temple by bringing gentiles into it he was seized and dragged out of the temple by an angry mob he narrowly escaped being killed by surrendering to a group of roman centurions who arrested him put him in chains and took him to the tribune acts 21 27 36 when a plot to kill paul on his way to an appearance before the jews was discovered he was transported by night to caesarea maritima he was held as a prisoner there for two years until a new governor reopened his case in 59 when the governor suggested that he be sent back to jerusalem for further trial paul exercised his right as a roman citizen to appeal unto caesar finally paul and his companions sailed for rome where paul was to stand trial for his alleged crimes his final days spent in rome acts recounts that on the way to rome for his appeal as a roman citizen to caesar paul was shipwrecked on melita malta acts 27 39 44 where the islanders showed him unusual kindness and where he was met by publius acts 28 1 10 from malta he travelled to rome via syracuse rhegium and puteoli acts 28 11 14 he finally arrived in rome around 60 where he spent another two years under house arrest the narrative of acts ends with paul preaching in rome for two years from his rented home while awaiting trial acts 28 30 31 irenaeus wrote in the 2nd century that peter and paul had been the founders of the church in rome and had appointed linus as succeeding bishop paul was not a bishop of rome nor did he bring christianity to rome since there were already christians in rome when he arrived there acts 28 14 15 also paul wrote his letter to the church at rome before he had visited rome romans 1 1711 13 15 23 29 paul only played a supporting part in the life of the church in rome death the new testament does not say when or how paul died there is an early tradition found in the writing of ignatius probably around 110 ad that paul was martyred dionysius of corinth in a letter to the romans 166 174 ad stated that paul and peter were martyred in italy eusebius also cites the dionysius passage the acts of paul an apocryphal work written around 160 describes the martyrdom of paul according to the acts of paul nero condemned paul to death by decapitation the date of paul 's death is believed to have occurred after the great fire of rome in july 64 but before the last year of nero 's reign in 68 a legend later developed that his martyrdom occurred at the acquae salviae on the via laurentina according to this legend after paul was decapitated his severed head rebounded three times giving rise to a source of water each time that it touched the ground which is how the place earned the name san paolo alle tre fontane st paul at the three fountains also according to legend paul 's body was buried outside the walls of rome at the second mile on the via ostiensis on the estate owned by a christian woman named lucina it was here in the fourth century that the emperor constantine built a first church then between the fourth and fifth centuries it was considerably enlarged by the emperors valentinian i valentinian ii theodosius i and arcadius the present day basilica of saint paul outside the walls was built there in 1800 tertullian in his prescription against heretics 200 ad writes that paul had a similar death to that of john the baptist who was beheaded eusebius of caesarea in his church history 320 ad testifies that paul was beheaded in rome and peter crucified he wrote that the tombs of these two apostles with their inscriptions were extant in his time and quotes as his authority a holy man of the name of caius lactantius wrote that nero crucified peter and slew paul 318 ad jerome in his de viris illustribus on illustrious men 392 ad states that paul was beheaded at rome john chrysostom c 349 407 wrote that nero knew paul personally and had him killed sulpicius severus says nero killed peter and paul 403 ad remains caius in his disputation against proclus 198 ad mentions this of the places in which the remains of the apostles peter and paul were deposited i can point out the trophies of the apostles for if you are willing to go to the vatican or to the ostian way you will find the trophies of those who founded this church jerome in his de viris illustribus 392 ad writing on paul 's biography mentions that paul was buried in the ostian way at rome in 2002 an 8 foot long marble sarcophagus inscribed with the words paulo apostolo mart paul apostle martyr was discovered during excavations around the basilica of saint paul outside the walls on the via ostiensis vatican archaeologists declared this to be the tomb of paul the apostle in 2005 in june 2009 pope benedict xvi announced excavation results concerning the tomb the sarcophagus was not opened but was examined by means of a probe which revealed pieces of incense purple and blue linen and small bone fragments the bone was radiocarbon dated to the 1st or 2nd century according to the vatican these findings support the conclusion that the tomb is paul 's writings of the 27 books in the new testament 14 have been attributed to paul 7 of these are widely considered authentic and paul 's own while the authorship of the other 7 is disputed the undisputed letters are considered the most important sources since they contain what everyone agrees to be paul 's own statements about his life and thoughts theologian mark powell writes that paul directed these 7 letters to specific occasions at particular churches as an example if the corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the lord 's supper 1 cor 11 17 34 today we would not know that paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about it one way or the other he asks if we might be ignorant of other matters simply because no crises arose that prompted paul to comment on them although approximately half of acts deals with paul 's life and works the book of acts does not refer to paul writing letters historians believe that the author of acts did not have access to any of paul 's letters one piece of evidence suggesting this is that acts never directly quotes from the pauline epistles discrepancies between the pauline epistles and acts would further support the conclusion that the author of acts did not have access to those epistles when composing acts in paul 's writings he provides the first written account of what it is to be a christian and thus a description of christian spirituality his letters have been characterized as being the most influential books of the new testament after the gospels of matthew and john paul only occasionally had the opportunity to revisit his churches he tried to keep up his converts' spirit answer their questions and resolve their problems by letter and by sending one or more of his assistants especially timothy and titus paul 's letters reveal a remarkable human being dedicated compassionate emotional sometimes harsh and angry clever and quick witted supple in argumentation and above all possessing a soaring passionate commitment to god jesus christ and his own mission fortunately after his death one of his followers collected some of the letters edited them very slightly and published them they constitute one of history 's most remarkable personal contributions to religious thought and practice basic message e p sanders finds three major emphases in paul 's writings his strongest emphasis was on the death resurrection and lordship of jesus christ he preached that one 's faith in jesus assures that person a share in jesus' life salvation he saw jesus' death as being for the believers' benefit not a defeat jesus died so that believers' sins would be forgiven the resurrection of jesus was of primary importance to paul as may be seen in his first letter to the thessalonians 1 thes 1 9 10 which is the earliest surviving account of paul 's conversion the resurrection brought the promise of salvation to believers paul taught that when christ returned those who had died believing in christ as the saviour of mankind would be brought back to life while those still alive would be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the lord in the air 1 thes 4 14 18 sanders concludes that paul 's writings reveal what he calls the essence of the christian message god sent his son the son was crucified for the sins of humanity after being dead three days the son was raised from the dead defeating death the son would soon return those in christ will live with him forever followers are urged to live by a set apart sanctified standard and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ 1 thes 5 23 authorship seven of the 13 letters that bear paul 's name romans 1 corinthians 2 corinthians galatians philippians 1 thessalonians and philemon are almost universally accepted as being entirely authentic dictated by paul himself they are considered the best source of information on paul 's life and especially his thought four of the letters ephesians 1 and 2 timothy and titus are widely considered pseudepigraphical while the authorship of the other two is subject to debate colossians and 2 thessalonians are thought by some to be deutero pauline meaning they may have been written by paul 's followers after his death similarly 1 timothy 2 timothy and titus may be trito pauline meaning they may have been written by members of the pauline school a generation after his death according to their theories these disputed letters may have come from followers writing in paul 's name often using material from his surviving letters these scribes also may have had access to letters written by paul that no longer survive the authenticity of colossians has been questioned on the grounds that it contains an otherwise unparalleled description among his writings of jesus as the image of the invisible god a christology found elsewhere only in john 's gospel however the personal notes in the letter connect it to philemon unquestionably the work of paul internal evidence shows close connection with philippians ephesians is a letter that is very similar to colossians but is almost entirely lacking in personal reminiscences its style is unique it lacks the emphasis on the cross to be found in other pauline writings reference to the second coming is missing and christian marriage is exalted in a way which contrasts with the reference in 1 cor 7 8 9 finally according to r e brown it exalts the church in a way suggestive of a second generation of christians built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets now past the defenders of its pauline authorship argue that it was intended to be read by a number of different churches and that it marks the final stage of the development of paul 's thinking it has been said too that the moral portion of the epistle consisting of the last two chapters has the closest affinity with similar portions of other epistles while the whole admirably fits in with the known details of paul 's life and throws considerable light upon them three main reasons have been advanced by those who question paul 's authorship of 1 timothy 2 timothy and titus also known as the pastoral epistles first they have found a difference in these letters' vocabulary style and theology from paul 's acknowledged writings defenders of the authenticity say that they were probably written in the name and with the authority of the apostle by one of his companions to whom he distinctly explained what had to be written or to whom he gave a written summary of the points to be developed and that when the letters were finished paul read them through approved them and signed them second some believe there is a difficulty in fitting them into paul 's biography as we have it they like colossians and ephesians were written from prison but suppose paul 's release and travel thereafter third 2 thessalonians like colossians is questioned by some on stylistic grounds with some noting among other peculiarities a dependence on 1 thessalonians yet a distinctiveness in language from the pauline corpus this again is explainable by the possibility that paul requested one of his companions to write the letter for him under his dictation atonement paul wrote down much of the theology of atonement paul taught that christians are redeemed from sin by jesus' death and resurrection his death was an expiation as well as a propitiation and by christ 's blood peace is made between god and man by grace through faith a christian shares in jesus' death and in his victory over death gaining as a free gift a new justified status of sonship relationship with judaism some scholars see paul or saul as completely in line with 1st century judaism a pharisee and student of gamaliel as presented by acts others see him as opposed to 1st century judaism notably marcionism while the majority see him as somewhere in between these two extremes opposed to ritual laws for example the circumcision controversy in early christianity but in full agreement on divine law these views of paul are paralleled by the views of biblical law in christianity paul 's theology of the gospel accelerated the separation of the messianic sect of christians from judaism a development contrary to paul 's own intent he wrote that faith in christ was alone decisive in salvation for jews and gentiles alike making the schism between the followers of christ and mainstream jews inevitable and permanent he argued that gentile converts did not need to become jews get circumcised follow jewish dietary restrictions or otherwise observe mosaic laws to be saved nevertheless in romans he insisted on the positive value of the law as a moral guide e p sanders' publications have since been taken up by professor james dunn who coined the phrase the new perspective on paul n t wright the anglican bishop of durham notes a difference in emphasis between galatians and romans the latter being much more positive about the continuing covenant between god and his ancient people than the former wright also contends that performing christian works is not insignificant but rather proof of having attained the redemption of jesus christ by grace free gift received by faith rom 2 13ff he concludes that paul distinguishes between performing christian works which are signs of ethnic identity and others which are a sign of obedience to christ world to come according to bart ehrman paul believed that jesus would return within his lifetime he states that paul expected that christians who had died in the mean time would be resurrected to share in god 's kingdom and he believed that the saved would be transformed assuming supernatural bodies paul 's teaching about the end of the world is expressed most clearly in his letters to the christians at thessalonica he assures them that the dead will rise first and be followed by those left alive 1 thes 4 16ff this suggests an imminent end but he is unspecific about times and seasons and encourages his hearers to expect a delay the form of the end will be a battle between jesus and the man of lawlessness 2 thess 2 3 whose conclusion is the triumph of christ role of women the second chapter of the first letter to timothy one of the six disputed letters is used by many churches to deny women a vote in church affairs reject women from serving as teachers of adult bible classes prevent them from serving as missionaries and generally disenfranchise women from the duties and privileges of church leadership the kjv translation of this passage taken literally says that women in the churches are to have no leadership roles vis vis men whether it also forbids women from teaching children and women is dubious as even those catholic churches that prohibit female priests permit female abbesses to teach and exercise authority over other females fuller seminary theologian j r daniel kirk finds evidence in paul 's letters of a much more inclusive view of women he writes that romans 16 is a tremendously important witness to the important role of women in the early church paul praises phoebe for her work as a deaconess and junia who is described by paul in scripture as being respected among the apostles romans 16 7 it is kirk 's observation that recent studies have led many scholars to conclude that the passage in 1 corinthians 14 ordering women to be silent during worship was a later addition apparently by a different author and not part of paul 's original letter to the corinthians other scholars such as giancarlo biguzzi believe that paul 's restriction on women speaking in 1 corinthians 14 is genuine to paul but applies to a particular case where there were local problems of women who were not allowed in that culture to become educated asking questions or chatting during worship services he does not believe it to be a general prohibition on any woman speaking in worship settings since in 1 corinthians paul affirms the right responsibility of women to prophesy 1 cor 11 biblical prophecy is more than fore telling two thirds of its inscripturated form involves forth telling that is setting the truth justice mercy and righteousness of god against the backdrop of every form of denial of the same thus to speak prophetically was to speak boldly against every form of moral ethical political economic and religious disenfranchisement observed in a culture that was intent on building its own pyramid of values vis a vis god 's established system of truth and ethics there were women prophets in the highly patriarchal times throughout the old testament the most common term for prophet in the old testament is nabi ayib n in the masculine form and nab ah h'ayibn in the hebrew feminine form is used six times of women who performed the same task of receiving and proclaiming the message given by god these women include miriam aaron and moses' sister exod 15 20 deborah judges 4 4 the prophet isaiah 's wife isa 8 3 and huldah the one who interpreted the book of the law discovered in the temple during the days of josiah 2 kings 22 14 2 chron 34 22 there were false prophetesses just as there were false prophets the prophetess noadiah was among those who tried to intimidate nehemiah neh 6 14 apparently they held equal rank in prophesying right along with abraham isaac jacob moses elisha aaron and samuel kirk 's third example of a more inclusive view is galatians 3 28 there is neither jew nor gentile neither slave nor free nor is there male and female for you are all one in christ jesus in pronouncing an end within the church to the divisions which are common in the world around it he concludes by highlighting the fact that there were new testament women who taught and had authority in the early churches that this teaching and authority was sanctioned by paul and that paul himself offers a theological paradigm within which overcoming the subjugation of women is an anticipated outcome classicist evelyn stagg and theologian frank stagg believe that paul was attempting to christianize the societal household or domestic codes that significantly oppressed women and empowered men as the head of the household the staggs present a serious study of what has been termed the new testament domestic code also known as the haustafel the two main passages that explain these household duties are paul 's letters to the ephesians 5 22 6 5 and to the colossians 3 18 4 1 an underlying household code is also reflected in four additional pauline letters and 1 peter 1 timothy 2 1ff 8ff 3 1ff 8ff 5 17ff 6 1f titus 2 1 10 and 1 peter 2 13 3 9 biblical scholars have typically treated the haustafel in ephesians as a resource in the debate over the role of women in ministry and in the home margaret macdonald argues that the haustafel particularly as it appears in ephesians was aimed at reducing the tension between community members and outsiders e p sanders has labeled the apostle 's remark in 1 cor 14 34 36 about women not making any sound during worship as paul 's intemperate outburst that women should be silent in the churches women in fact played a very significant part in paul 's missionary endeavors he became a partner in ministry with the couple priscilla and aquila who are specifically named seven times in the new testament always by their couple name and never individually of the seven times they are named in the new testament priscilla 's name appears first in five of those instances suggesting to some scholars that she was the head of the family unit they lived worked and traveled with the apostle paul becoming his honored much loved friends and coworkers in christ jesus in romans 16 3 4 thought to have been written in 56 or 57 paul sends his greetings to priscilla and aquila and proclaims that both of them risked their necks to save paul 's life chloe was an important member of the church in corinth 1 cor 1 11 phoebe was a deacon and a benefactor of paul and others rom 16 1 2 romans 16 names eight other women active in the christian movement including junia prominent among the apostles mary who has worked very hard among you and julia women were frequently among the major supporters of the new christian movement views on homosexuality most christian traditions say paul clearly portrays homosexuality as sinful in two specific locations romans 1 26 27 and 1 corinthians 6 9 10 another well known passage addresses the topic more obliquely 1 timothy 1 8 11 since the nineteenth century however some scholars have concluded that 1 timothy along with 2 timothy and titus are not original to paul but rather an unknown christian writing in paul 's name some time in the late first to mid 2nd century influence on christianity paul 's influence on christian thinking arguably has been more significant than any other new testament author paul declared that christ is the end of the law exalted the christian church as the body of christ and depicted the world outside the church as under judgment paul 's writings include the earliest reference to the lord 's supper a rite traditionally identified as the christian communion or eucharist in the east church fathers attributed the element of election in romans 9 to divine foreknowledge the themes of predestination found in western christianity do not appear in eastern theology augustine 's foundational work on the gospel as a gift grace on morality as life in the spirit on predestination and on original sin all derives from paul especially romans modern theology in his commentary the epistle to the romans ger der r merbrief particularly in the thoroughly re written second edition of 1922 karl barth argued that the god who is revealed in the cross of jesus challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally god with human cultures achievements or possessions some theologians believe this work to be the most important theological treatise since friedrich schleiermacher 's on religion speeches to its cultured despisers in addition to the many questions about the true origins of some of paul 's teachings posed by historical figures as noted above some modern theologians also hold that the teachings of paul differ markedly from those of jesus as found in the gospels barrie wilson states that paul differs from jesus in terms of the origin of his message his teachings and his practices some have even gone so far as to claim that due to these apparent differences in teachings that paul was actually no less than the second founder of christianity jesus being its first robert m price in his book the amazing colossal apostle the search for the historical paul says the pauline epistles reveal themselves to the discerning reader to have exactly the same sort of limitation as the gospels do both are collections of fragments and pericopae contributed and fabricated by authors and communities of very different theological leanings as in the eastern tradition in general western humanists interpret the reference to election in romans 9 as reflecting divine foreknowledge church tradition various christian writers have suggested more details about paul 's life 1 clement a letter written by the roman bishop clement of rome around the year 90 reports this about paul by reason of jealousy and strife paul by his example pointed out the prize of patient endurance after that he had been seven times in bonds had been driven into exile had been stoned had preached in the east and in the west he won the noble renown which was the reward of his faith having taught righteousness unto the whole world and having reached the farthest bounds of the west and when he had borne his testimony before the rulers so he departed from the world and went unto the holy place having been found a notable pattern of patient endurance commenting on this passage raymond brown writes that while it does not explicitly say that paul was martyred in rome such a martyrdom is the most reasonable interpretation eusebius of caesarea who wrote in the 4th century states that paul was beheaded in the reign of the roman emperor nero this event has been dated either to the year 64 when rome was devastated by a fire or a few years later to 67 according to one tradition the church of san paolo alle tre fontane marks the place of paul 's execution a roman catholic liturgical solemnity of peter and paul celebrated on june 29 commemorates his martyrdom and reflects a tradition preserved by eusebius that peter and paul were martyred at the same time the roman liturgical calendar for the following day now remembers all christians martyred in these early persecutions formerly june 30 was the feast day for st paul persons or religious orders with special affinity for st paul can still celebrate their patron on june 30 the apocryphal acts of paul and the apocryphal acts of peter suggest that paul survived rome and traveled further west some think that paul could have revisited greece and asia minor after his trip to spain and might then have been arrested in troas and taken to rome and executed 2 tim 4 13 a tradition holds that paul was interred with saint peter ad catacumbas by the via appia until moved to what is now the basilica of saint paul outside the walls in rome bede in his ecclesiastical history writes that pope vitalian in 665 gave paul 's relics including a cross made from his prison chains from the crypts of lucina to king oswy of northumbria northern britain paul is considered the patron saint of london the feast of the conversion of saint paul is celebrated on january 25 islamic view muslims have long believed that paul purposefully corrupted the original revealed teachings of jesus through the introduction of such elements as paganism the making of christianity into a theology of the cross and introducing original sin and the need for redemption in sunni polemics paul plays the same role of deliberately corrupting the early teachings of jesus as a later jew abdullah ibn saba' would play in seeking to destroy the message of islam from within by introducing proto shi'ite beliefs among those who supported this view were scholars ibn taymiyyah who believed while paul ultimately succeeded ibn saba failed and ibn hazm who claimed that the jews even admitted to paul 's sinister purpose jewish views jewish interest in paul is a recent phenomenon before the so called jewish reclamation of jesus as a jew in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries he had hardly featured in the popular jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars arguably he is absent from the talmud and rabbinical literature although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic toledot yeshu as a spy for the rabbis but with jesus no longer regarded as the paradigm of gentile christianity paul 's position became more important in jewish historical reconstructions of their religion 's relationship with christianity he has featured as the key to building barriers e g heinrich graetz and martin buber or bridges e g isaac mayer wise and claude g montefiore in interfaith relations as part of an intra jewish debate about what constitutes jewish authenticity e g joseph klausner and hans joachim schoeps and on occasion as a dialogical partner e g richard l rubenstein and daniel boyarin he features in an oratorio by felix mendelssohn a painting by ludwig meidner and a play by franz werfel and there have been several novels about paul by shalom asch and samuel sandmel jewish philosophers including baruch spinoza leo shestov and jacob taubes and jewish psychoanalysts including sigmund freud and hanns sachs have engaged with the apostle as one of the most influential figures in western thought scholarly surveys of jewish interest in paul include those by hagner 1980 meissner 1996 and langton 2010 2011 literary analysis writing styles british jewish scholar hyam maccoby contended that the paul as described in the book of acts and the view of paul gleaned from his own writings are very different people some difficulties have been noted in the account of his life paul as described in the book of acts is much more interested in factual history less in theology ideas such as justification by faith are absent as are references to the spirit according to maccoby he also pointed out that there are no references to john the baptist in the pauline epistles although paul mentions him several times in the book of acts others have objected that the language of the speeches is too lukan in style to reflect anyone else 's words moreover george shillington writes that the author of acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bear his literary and theological marks conversely howard marshall writes that the speeches were not entirely the inventions of the author and while they may not be accurate word for word the author nevertheless records the general idea of them f c baur 1792 1860 professor of theology at t bingen in germany the first scholar to critique acts and the pauline epistles and founder of the t bingen school of theology argued that paul as the apostle to the gentiles was in violent opposition to the original 12 apostles baur considers the acts of the apostles were late and unreliable this debate has continued ever since with adolf deissmann 1866 1937 and richard reitzenstein 1861 1931 emphasising paul 's greek inheritance and albert schweitzer stressing his dependence on judaism other views in the second and possibly late first century gnosticism was a competing religious tradition to christianity which shared some elements of theology elaine pagels professor of religion at princeton university and an authority on gnosticism declined to judge in her book the gnostic paul whether paul was actually a gnostic instead she concentrated on how the gnostics interpreted paul 's letters and how evidence from gnostic sources may challenge the assumption that paul wrote his letters to combat gnostic opponents and to repudiate their statement that they possess secret wisdom professor robert eisenman of california state university long beach argues that paul was a member of the family of herod the great eisenman makes a connection between paul and an individual identified by josephus as saulus a kinsman of agrippa another oft cited element of the case for paul as a member of herod 's family is found in romans 16 11 where paul writes greet herodion my kinsman according to timo eskola early christian theology and discourse was influenced by the jewish merkabah tradition similarly alan segal and daniel boyarin regard paul 's accounts of his conversion experience and his ascent to the heavens as the earliest first person accounts we have of a merkabah mystic in jewish or christian literature conversely timothy churchill has argued that paul 's damascus road encounter does not fit the pattern of merkabah among the critics of paul the apostle was thomas jefferson a deist who wrote that paul was the first corrupter of the doctrines of jesus christian anarchists such as leo tolstoy and ammon hennacy take a similar view f f powell argues that paul in his epistles made use of many of the ideas of the greek philosopher plato sometimes even using the same metaphors and language for example in phaedrus plato has socrates saying that the heavenly ideals are perceived as though through a glass dimly paul 's language closely mirrors this phrase 1 corinthians 13 the latest research into the life of paul disputes his claim of conversion in 2015 independent researchers p j gott and logan licht reported evidence they discovered that suggests the books of the new testament were written in enigmatical modes of expression the method philo the alexandrian jew attributes to the essene sect of judaism josephus the jewish historian writes the essenes also as we call a sect of ours live the same kind of life as do those whom the greeks call pythagoreans the greek historian plutarch ties pythagoreans and enigmatical modes of expression together pythagoras greatly admired the egyptian priests and copying their symbolism and secret teachings incorporated his doctrines in enigmas after testing philo 's essene method as reconstructed by heresy hunters in the 17th century they conclude that acts' paulus also known as saulus was the same saulus josephus blames for the events that led to the destruction of the temple in 70 physical appearance the new testament offers little if any information about the physical appearance of paul but several descriptions can be found in apocryphal texts in the acts of paul he is described as a man of small stature with a bald head and crooked legs in a good state of body with eyebrows meeting and nose somewhat hooked and in the latin version of the acts of paul and thecla it is added that he had a red florid face in the history of the contending of saint paul his countenance is actually described as ruddy with the ruddiness of the skin of the pomegranate and the acts of saint peter confirms that paul had a bald and shining head with red hair as summarised by barnes chrysostom records that paul 's stature was low his body crooked and his head bald lucian in his philopatris describes paul as corpore erat parvo he was small contracto contracted incurvo crooked tricubitali of three cubits or four feet six while nicephorus claims that paul was a little man crooked and almost bent like a bow with a pale countenance long and wrinkled and a bald head pseudo chrysostom echoes lucian 's height of paul referring to him as the man of three cubits paul himself admits to having been abnormally born perhaps suggesting some kind of deformity such as being crooked or hunch backed that tormented him see also further reading bart d ehrman peter paul and

early history at the time of european encounter the inhabitants of the area that became greensboro were a siouan speaking people called the saura other indigenous cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years typically settling along the waterways as did the early settlers quaker migrants from pennsylvania by way of maryland arrived at capefair now greensboro in about 1750 the new settlers began organized religious services affiliated with the cane creek friends meeting in snow camp in 1751 three years later 40 quaker families were granted approval to establish new garden monthly meeting the action is recorded in the minutes of the perquimans and little river quarterly meeting on may 25 1754 to friends at new garden in capefair signed by joseph ratliff the settlement grew rapidly during the next three years adding members from as far away as nantucket in massachusetts it soon became the most important quaker community in north carolina and mother of several other quaker meetings that were established in the state and west of the appalachians after the revolutionary war the city of greensboro was named for major general nathanael greene commander of the rebel american forces at the battle of guilford court house on march 15 1781 although the americans lost the battle greene 's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the british army of general cornwallis following this battle cornwallis withdrew his troops to a british coastal base in wilmington north carolina greensboro was established near the geographic center of guilford county on land that was an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of huckleberry bushes that bore a finely flavored fruit property for the future village was purchased from the saura for 98 three north south streets greene elm davie were laid out intersecting with three east west streets gaston market sycamore the courthouse was built at the center of the intersection of elm and market streets by 1821 the town was home to 369 residents in the early 1840s greensboro was designated by the state government as one of the stops on a new railroad line at the request of governor john motley morehead whose plantation blandwood was in greensboro stimulated by rail traffic and improved access to markets the city grew substantially soon becoming known as the gate city due to its role as a transportation hub for the piedmont the railroads transported goods to and from the cotton textile mills many of the manufacturers developed workers' housing in mill villages near their facilities textile companies and related businesses continued into the 21st century when most went bankrupt reorganized and or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry with the main offices of international textile group cone burlington industries galey lord unifi and vf corporation wrangler lee the north face and nautica itg brands maker of kool winston and salem brand cigarettes is the third largest tobacco company in the united states and is headquartered in greensboro rail traffic continues to be important for the city 's economy as greensboro is a major regional freight hub in addition four amtrak passenger trains stop in greensboro daily on the main norfolk southern line between washington and new orleans by way of atlanta though the city developed slowly early wealth generated in the 18th and 19th centuries from cotton trade and merchandising resulted in owners' constructing several notable buildings the earliest later named blandwood mansion and gardens was built by a planter in 1795 additions to this residence in 1846 designed by alexander jackson davis of new york city made the house influential as america 's earliest tuscan style villa it has been designated as a national historic landmark other significant plantation houses and estates were developed including dunleith designed by samuel sloan bellemeade and the bumpass troy house since the late 20th century the latter has been adapted and operates as a private inn civil war and last days of the confederacy in the mid 19th century many of the residents of the piedmont and western areas of the state were unionist and guilford county did not vote for secession but once north carolina joined the confederacy some citizens joined the confederate cause forming such infantry units as the guilford grays to fight in the civil war from 1861 to march 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war although residents had to deal with the regional shortages of clothing medicines and other items caused by the us naval blockade of the south in the final weeks of the war greensboro played a unique role in the last days of the confederate government in april 1865 general p g t beauregard was instructed by the commanding officer of the army of tennessee general joseph e johnston to prepare for a defense of the city during this time confederate president jefferson davis and the remaining members of the confederate cabinet had evacuated the confederate capital in richmond virginia and moved south to danville virginia when union cavalry threatened danville davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train and reassembled in greensboro on april 11 1865 while in the city davis and his cabinet decided to try to escape overseas in order to avoid capture by the victorious union forces they left greensboro and separated greensboro is notable as the last place where the entire confederate government met as a group it is considered the final capital city of the confederacy at nearly the same time governor zebulon b vance fled raleigh the capital of north carolina before the forces of union general william tecumseh sherman swept the city for a brief period beginning april 16 1865 he and other officials maintained the state capital in greensboro governor vance proclaimed the north carolina surrender declaration on april 28 1865 later vance surrendered to union officials in the parlor of blandwood mansion historian blackwell robinson wrote greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state once surrender negotiations were completed at bennett place in present day durham north carolina between general johnston and general sherman on april 26 1865 confederate soldiers in greensboro stacked their arms and received their paroles and headed for home industrialization and growth after the war investors worked to restore the textile mills and related industry in the 1890s the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists including moses and caesar cone of baltimore maryland the cone brothers established large scale textile plants changing greensboro from a village to a city within a decade by 1900 greensboro was considered a center of the southern textile industry with large scale factories producing denim flannel and overalls the resulting prosperity was expressed in the construction of notable twentieth century civic architecture including the guilford county courthouse west market street united methodist church by s w faulk several buildings designed by frank a weston and the julius i foust building of the university of north carolina at greensboro designed by orlo epps during the twentieth century greensboro continued to increase in population and wealth grand commercial and civic buildings many of which still stand today were designed by local architects charles hartmann and harry barton other notable industries became established in the city including vicks chemical co famous for over the counter cold remedies such as vaporub and nyquil carolina steel corporation and pomona terra cotta works during the first three decades greensboro grew so rapidly that there was an acute worker housing shortage builders set a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year to provide homes for workers greensboro 's real estate was considered the wonder of the state during the 1920s growth continued even through the great depression as greensboro attracted an estimated 200 new families per year to its population the city earned a reputation as a well planned community with a strong emphasis on education parks and a profitable employment base it has two major public research universities north carolina a t state university a historically black college established in the late 19th century and the university of north carolina at greensboro during the height of the civil rights movement in the early 1960s students from a t were the major force in protests to achieve racial justice desegregation of public facilities and fair employment beginning with the greensboro four who sat in at the segregated lunch counter at woolworth 's in 1960 to gain service the largest civil rights protests in north carolina history took place in greensboro in may and june 1963 in the 21st century the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science on which the city hopes to build a new economy wartime and postwar prosperity brought development and designs commissioned from nationally and internationally known architects for instance walter gropius a leader of the german bauhaus movement in the united states designed a factory building in the city in 1944 greensboro based ed loewenstein designed projects throughout the region eduardo catalano and george matsumoto were hired for projects whose designs have challenged north carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms civil rights movement in 1960 the census bureau reported greensboro 's population as 74 0 white and 25 8 black as in the rest of the state most blacks were still disenfranchised under state laws jim crow laws and customs were in effect and public facilities including schools were racially segregated by law this was after the us supreme court ruling in brown v board of education 1954 that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments which were dominated by conservative white democrats in the postwar period blacks pushed in north carolina and across the south to regain the ability to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens college students from north carolina agricultural and technical college a t a historically black college made greensboro a center of protests and change on february 1 1960 four black college students sat down at an all white woolworth 's lunch counter and refused to leave after they were denied service they had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts after being denied lunch service they brought out the receipts asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit in which lasted several months such protests quickly spread across the south ultimately leading to the desegregation of lunch counters and other facilities at woolworth 's and other chains woolworth 's went out of business due to changes in 20th century retail practices but the original woolworth 's lunch counter and stools are still in their original location the former woolworth 's building has been adapted as the international civil rights center and museum which opened on february 1 2010 the 50th anniversary of the sit ins a section of the counter is on display at the smithsonian in washington d c to mark the courage of the civil rights protesters the white business community acceded to the desegregation of woolworth 's and made other minor concessions but the civil rights movement had additional goals holding protests in 1962 and 1963 in may and june 1963 the largest civil rights protest in north carolina history took place in greensboro protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations and economic and social justice such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race they also worked for the overdue integration of public schools as the us supreme court had ruled in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional each night more than 2000 protesters marched through greensboro 's segregated central business district william thomas and a knighton stanley coordinators of greensboro 's local core chapter invited jesse jackson then an activist student at a t to join the protests jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader becoming the public spokesman of the non violent protest movement seeking to overwhelm city jails as was done in protests led by dr martin luther king jr in birmingham alabama the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses they were charged with trespassing and other non violent actions college and high school students constituted most of the protesters and at one point approximately 1400 blacks were jailed in the city of greensboro the scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and governor terry sanford finally the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities reformed hiring policies in city government and commitments to progress by both greensboro 's mayor and governor sanford sanford declared anyone who has n't received this message does n't understand human nature significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways dudley high school a t protests in may 1969 students of james b dudley high school were outraged when the administration refused to let a popular candidate run for student union class president allegedly due to his membership in youth for the unity of black society after their appeals to the school were rejected the students asked activists at north carolina a t state university for support in a protest protests escalated and after students at a t had thrown rocks at police they returned on may 21 armed with tear gas canisters using this against the crowds the uprising grew larger and the governor ordered the national guard to back up local police after there were exchanges of gunfire the governor ordered the national guard into the a t campus in what was described at the time as the most massive armed assault ever made against an american university the national guard swept the college dormitories taking hundreds of students into protective custody the demonstrations were suppressed the disturbances were investigated by the north carolina state advisory committee to the united states commission on civil rights its 1970 report concluded that the national guard invasion was a reckless action as it was disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests it criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the dudley high school students when the issues first arose they declared it a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the dudley students seriously were the students at a t state university greensboro massacre while making progress african americans in greensboro continued to suffer acts of prejudice on november 3 1979 members of the communist workers party cwp held an anti ku klux klan rally in the black morningside heights neighborhood it was covered by four local tv news stations

killing five demonstrators and wounding seven television footage of the actions was shown nationwide and around the world and the event became known as the greensboro massacre in november 1980 six kkk defendants were each acquitted in a state criminal trial by an all white jury after a week of deliberations families of those killed and injured in the attack filed a civil suit against the city and police department for failure to protect the black citizens in 1985 a jury in this case found five police officers and two other individuals liable for 350000 in damages the monies were to be paid to

of his assistant ministers as having responsibility for external relations he is now often described as the island 's 'foreign minister' tax information exchange agreements tieas have been signed directly by the island with several countries relationship with the european union jersey is neither a member state nor an associate member of the european union it does however have a relationship with the eu governed by article 3355c tfeu giving effect to protocol 3 to the uk s treaty of accession in 1972 however jersey does not appear on the list of european states and territories outside the union and the communities prepared by the european council and the commission this is a result of the manner of implementation of the treaty arrangements under the act of accession in 1972 jersey would have been fully within the european communities like gibraltar being a european territory for whose external relations the united kingdom was responsible but that that is limited to the protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 tfeu to reflect the then existing relationship with the united kingdom under protocol 3 jersey is part of the european union customs union of the european community the common customs tariff levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non member states there is free movement of goods and trade between the island and member states eu rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in jersey however article 4 of the protocol requires the island 's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the communities in pereira the ecj held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the treaties in a territory where the treaties are fully applicable the island is therefore within the scope of the treaties to a limited extent as a european territory to infer as the french ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue namely that the island is outside the european union and communities without qualification is therefore simplistic in law false the french blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out as a result jersey is not part of the single market in financial services it is not required to implement eu directives on such matters as movement of capital company law or money laundering however the island 's close proximity 135 km south and its close association with the financial sector of the u k has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years with several mainline publications e g the wall street journal labelling the island a tax haven british citizens who have only a connection to jersey and not with the united kingdom or another member state of the european union are not considered by the jersey states to be european union citizens they have 'islander status' and their jersey issued british passports are endorsed with the words the holder is not entitled to benefit from eu provisions relating to employment or establishment however it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 tfeu are partly available to them as british citizens given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the protocol that restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all community or union rights the freedom of movement under the prior ec r gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the citizen rights under article 20 and 21 tfeu which include the right to move and reside those rights are primary citizenship rights not a mere freedom it might not need a treaty change to perfect this merely a preliminary ruling from the cjeu and supplementary implementation measures from the council given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to eu nationals via article 4 of the protocol jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the european parliament jersey and guernsey jointly opened an office in brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with european union institutions separation debate the question of an independent jersey has been discussed from time to time in the assembly of the states of jersey in 2005 08 a working group of the states of jersey examined the options for independence concluding that jersey 'is equipped to face the challenges of independence' but making no recommendations proposals for jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the states in october 2012 the council of ministers issued a common policy for external relations that noted that it is not government policy to seek independence from the united kingdom but rather to ensure that jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of islanders to do so on the basis of the established principles the council of ministers decided to ensure that jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the island s formal relationship with the united kingdom and or european union geography jersey is an island measuring 118 2 square kilometres 66436 verg e 44 87 sq mi including reclaimed land and intertidal zone it lies in the english channel about 12 nautical miles 22 km 14 mi from the cotentin peninsula in normandy france and about 87 nautical miles 161 km 100 mi south of great britain it is the largest and southernmost of the channel islands with a maximum land elevation of 143 m 469 ft above sea level at wa 57795 06708 current utm30 grid climate the climate is temperate with mild winters and mild to warm summers the atlantic ocean has a moderating effect on temperature in jersey as water has a much greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year this has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer the highest temperature recorded was 36 0 c 96 8 f on 9 august 2003 and the lowest temperature recorded was 10 3 c 13 5 f on 5 january 1894 by comparison higher temperatures are found in mainland united kingdom which achieved 38 5 c 101 3 f in faversham kent on 10 august 2003 the impact of the atlantic ocean and coastal winds ensure that jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of england during the summer months snow falls rarely in jersey some years will pass with no snow fall at all the terrain consists of a plateau sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north the plateau is cut by valleys running generally north south the following table contains the official met office station averages for 1981 2010 for jersey being located 7 2 kilometres 4 5 mi from st helier economy jersey 's economy is based on financial services 40 of gva in 2012 tourism hospitality hotels restaurants bars transport communications totalling 8 4 of gva in 2012 retail and wholesale 7 of gva in 2012 construction 6 2 of gva in 2012 and agriculture 1 3 of gva in 2012 thanks to specialisation in a few high return sectors at purchasing power parity jersey has high economic output per capita substantially ahead of all of the world 's large developed economies gross national income in 2009 was 3 7 billion approximately 40000 per head of population however this is not indicative of each individual resident 's purchasing power and the actual standard of living in jersey is comparable to that in the united kingdom outside central london the island is recognised as one of the leading offshore financial centres the growth of this sector however has not been without its controversies as jersey has been characterised by critics and detractors as a place in which the leadership has essentially been captured by global finance and whose members will threaten and intimidate anyone who dissents in june 2005 the states introduced the competition jersey law 2005 to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth this competition law was based on that of other jurisdictions tourism supports not only hotels but also retail and services in 2009 there were 685200 visitors spending 230 million duty free goods are available for purchase on travel to and from the island in 2009 57 of the island 's area was agricultural land an increase on 2008 major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce agriculture 's share of gva increased 5 in 2009 a fifth successive year of growth jersey cattle are a small breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream although the quality of its meat is also appreciated on a small scale the herd total in 2009 was 5090 animals fisheries and aquaculture make use of jersey 's marine resources to a total value of over 6 million in 2009 farmers and growers often sell surplus food and flowers in boxes on the roadside relying on the honesty of customers to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want in the 21st century diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the roadside stalls 53460 people were employed in jersey as of december 2010 24 in financial and legal services 16 in wholesale and retail trades 16 in the public sector 10 in education health and other private sector services 10 in construction and quarrying 9 in hotels restaurants and bars jersey along with guernsey has its own lottery called the channel islands lottery that was launched in 1975 on 18 february 2005 jersey was granted fairtrade island status taxation until the 20th century the states relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of jersey the levying of imp ts duties different from those of the united kingdom was granted by charles ii and remained in the hands of the assembly of governor bailiff and jurats until 1921 when that body 's tax raising powers were transferred to the assembly of the states leaving the assembly of governor bailiff and jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol this fiscal reform also stripped the lieutenant governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions the income tax law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in english income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20 set by the occupying germans during the second world war because value added tax vat has not been levied in the island luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the uk or in france providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries the absence of vat has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry whereby low value luxury items such as videos lingerie and contact lenses are exported avoiding vat on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products in 2005 the states of jersey announced limits on licences granted to non resident companies trading in this way low value consignment relief provided the mechanism for vat free imports from the channel islands to the uk until 1 april 2012 at which time this policy of the uk government was binned although jersey does not have vat the states of jersey introduced a goods and services tax gst on 6 may 2008 at a standard rate of 3 the rate was amended to 5 on 1 june 2011 although gst is at 5 shopping in jersey is still far more expensive than in the uk food is not exempt unlike with vat jersey is not subject to european union fiscal legislation and its zero ten legislation will be compliant with the code of conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti avoidance legislation as of 31 december 2011 which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the code of conduct group a subsidiary body of ecofin the code of conduct group at least in theory keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential the european commission has confirmed that the code is not a legal instrument and therefore is not legally binding only becoming of limited political authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the group at the end of the presidency concerned jersey is ranked as a tax haven by many organisations with the financial secrecy index ranking jersey as 16th one rank behind the united kingdom as of 2015 currency jersey issues its own postage stamps and jersey banknotes and coins that circulate with uk coinage bank of england notes scottish notes and guernsey currency within

island 's population was born in jersey 31 of the population were born elsewhere in the british isles 7 in continental portugal or madeira 8 in other european countries and 4 elsewhere the people of jersey are often called islanders or in individual terms jerseyman or jerseywoman some jersey born people identify as british immigration jersey belongs to the common travel area and the definition of united kingdom in the british nationality act 1981 is interpreted as including the uk and the islands together for immigration and nationality purposes the united kingdom generally treats jersey as though it were part of the uk jersey is constitutionally entitled to restrict immigration by non jersey residents but control of immigration at the point of entry cannot be introduced for british certain commonwealth and eea nationals without change to existing international law immigration is therefore controlled by a mixture of restrictions on those without residential status purchasing or renting property in the island and restrictions on employment migration policy is to move to a registration system to integrate residential and employment status jersey maintains its own immigration and border controls united kingdom immigration legislation may be extended to jersey by order in council subject to exceptions and adaptations following consultation with jersey and with jersey 's consent although jersey citizens are full british citizens an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in european union states other than the uk is placed in the passports of british citizens connected solely with the channel islands and isle of man those who have a parent or grandparent born in the united kingdom or who have lived in the united kingdom for five years are not subject to this restriction historical large scale immigration was facilitated by the introduction of steamships from 1823 by 1840 up to 5000 english people mostly half pay officers and their families had settled in jersey in the aftermath of 1848 polish russian hungarian italian and french political refugees came to jersey following louis napol on 's coup of 1851 more french proscrits arrived by the end of the 19th century well to do british families attracted by the lack of income tax were settling in jersey in increasing numbers establishing st helier as a predominantly english speaking town seasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on bretons and mainland normans from the 19th century the growth of tourism attracted staff from the united kingdom following liberation in 1945 agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the united kingdom the demands of reconstruction in mainland normandy and brittany employed domestic labour until the 1960s the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60000 excluding the occupation years economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population which is now 2013 about 100000 from the 1960s portuguese workers arrived mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism immigration has helped give aspects of jersey a distinct urban character particularly in and around the parish of st helier which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island religion in jersey religion in jersey has a complex history and much diversity the established church is the church of england from 2015 under the see of canterbury previously under the winchester diocese in the countryside methodism found its traditional stronghold a substantial minority of roman catholics can also be found in jersey there are two catholic private secondary schools de la salle college in saint saviour is an all boys school and beaulieu convent

the language particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes there have been efforts to revive j rriais in schools and the highest number of declared j rriais speakers is in the capital the dialects of j rriais differ in phonology and to a lesser extent lexis between parishes with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east many place names are in j rriais and french and english place names are also to be found anglicisation of the place names increased apace with the migration of english people to the island some neolithic carvings are the earliest

spanish empire ships commanded by juan rodr guez cabrillo sailed into san diego harbor early explorations by spanish conquistadors such as these led to spanish claims of the land the historic land on which chula vista sits became part of the 1795 land grant known as rancho del rey or the king 's ranch the land eventually was renamed rancho de la naci n during the mexican american war california

beautiful and its symbol is the fountain at lake eola orlando is also known as the theme park capital of the world and in 2014 its tourist attractions and events drew more than 62 million visitors the orlando international airport mco is the thirteenth busiest airport in the united states and the 29th busiest in the world buddy dyer is orlando 's mayor as one of the world 's most visited tourist

major attractions are located along international drive the city is also one of the busiest american cities for conferences and conventions the orange county convention center is the second largest convention facility in the united states like other major cities in the sun belt orlando grew rapidly during the 1980s and into the first decade of the 21st century orlando is home to the university of central florida which is the largest university campus in the united states in terms of enrollment as of 2015 in 2010 orlando was listed as a gamma level of world city in the world cities study group 's inventory orlando ranks as the fourth most popular american city based on where people want to live according to a 2009 pew research center study etymology prior to being known by its current name orlando was known as jernigan this originates from the first permanent settler aaron jernigan a cattleman who acquired land along lake holden by the terms of the armed occupation act of 1842 although there are at least three major stories as to how orlando got its name see below it is known for certain that the city of jernigan was renamed orlando in 1857 the move is believed to be sparked in part by aaron jernigan 's fall from grace after he was relieved of his military command by military officials in 1856 his behavior was so notorious that secretary of war jefferson davis wrote it is said they jernigan 's militia are more dreadful than the indians at a meeting in 1857 debate had grown concerning the name of the town pioneer william b hull recalled how james speer a local resident and prominent figure in one of the stories behind the naming of orlando rose in the heat of the argument and said this place is often spoken of as 'orlando 's grave ' let 's drop the word 'grave' and let the county seat be orlando through this retelling of history it is believed that a marker of some sort was indeed found by jernigan or one of the other original pioneers however others claim speer simply used the orlando reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the shakespearean character see below orlando reeves the most common story and the one purported by city officials is that the name orlando originated from a soldier named orlando reeves who died in 1835 during a supposed attack by native americans in the area during the second seminole war reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of sandy beach lake now lake eola the legend grew throughout the early 1900s particularly with local historian kena fries' retelling in various writings and on local radio station wdbo in 1929 a memorial beside lake eola originally placed by students of orlando 's cherokee junior school in 1939 designates the spot where the city 's supposed namesake fell there are conflicting legends however as an in depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s turned up no record of orlando reeves ever existing some variants attempt to account for reeves having no military records by using the name of another 'orlando' that exists in some written records orlando acosta however not much is known about acosta or if he even existed orlando rees a second variation places the naming around the time of the second seminole war this name is taken from a south carolinian cattle rancher named orlando savage rees rees owned several large estates in florida and mississippi on two separate occasions relatives of rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city f k bull of south carolina rees' great grandson told an orlando reporter of a story in 1955 years later charles m bull jr of orlando rees' great great grandson offered local historians similar information unlike orlando reeves who cannot be traced to any historical record there is considerable record that orlando rees did exist and was in florida during that time period in 1832 john james audubon met with rees in his large estate at spring garden about 45 minutes away from orlando in 1837 rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops rees' sugar farms in the area were burned out in the seminole attacks in 1835 the year orlando reeves supposedly died subsequently rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle it is believed rees could have left a pine bough marker with his name next to the trail later residents misread rees as reeves and also mistook it as a grave maker in subsequent years this story has merged with the orlando reeves story orlando as you like it the final variation has the city named after the protagonist in the shakespeare play as you like it in 1975 judge donald a cheney put forth a new version of the story in an orlando sentinel article cheney a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission recounted a story told to him by his father judge john moses cheney a major figure in orlando 's history who arrived in orlando in 1885 the elder cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time james speer proposed the name orlando after the character in as you like it' ' according to cheney speer was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of william shakespeare according to him orlando was a veritable forest of arden the locale of 'as you like it ' speer 's descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow this account also has some validity in that as mentioned above speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from jernigan to orlando though he may have used the orlando reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the shakespearean character it should also be noted that one of downtown orlando 's major streets is named rosalind avenue rosalind is the heroine of as you like it history pre european history before european settlers arrived in 1536 orlando was sparsely populated by the seminole tribe there are very few archaeological sites in the area today except for the ruins of fort gatlin along the shores of modern day lake gatlin south of downtown orlando incorporation after mosquito county was divided in 1845 orlando became the county seat of the new orange county in 1856 it remained a rural backwater during the civil war and suffered greatly during the union blockade the reconstruction era brought on a population explosion resulting in orlando 's incorporation as a town on july 31 1875 and as a city in 1885 the period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as orlando 's golden era when it became the hub of florida 's citrus industry but the great freeze of 1894 95 forced many owners to give up their independent groves thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few citrus barons who shifted operations south primarily around lake wales in polk county notable homesteaders in the area included the curry family through their property in east orlando flowed the econlockhatchee river which travelers crossed by fording this would be commemorated by the street 's name curry ford road also just south of the airport in the boggy creek area was 150 acres 0 61 km2 of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the ward family this property is still owned by the ward family and can be seen from flights out of orlando international airport southbound immediately on the south side of sr 417 post industrial revolution orlando as florida 's largest inland city became a popular resort during the years between the spanish american war and world war i in the 1920s orlando experienced extensive housing development during the florida land boom land prices soared during this period several neighborhoods in downtown were constructed endowing it with many bungalows the boom ended when several hurricanes hit florida in the late 1920s along with the great depression during world war ii a number of army personnel were stationed at the orlando army air base and nearby pinecastle army air field some of these servicemen stayed in orlando to settle and raise families in 1956 the aerospace and defense company martin marietta now lockheed martin established a plant in the city orlando aab and pinecastle aaf were transferred to the united states air force in 1947 when it became a separate service and were re designated as air force bases afb in 1958 pinecastle afb was renamed mccoy air force base after colonel michael n w mccoy a former commander of the 320th bombardment wing at the installation killed in the crash of a b 47 stratojet bomber north of orlando in the 1960s the base subsequently became home to the 306th bombardment wing of the strategic air command sac operating b 52 stratofortress and kc 135 stratotanker aircraft in addition to detachment operations by ec 121 and u 2 aircraft in 1968 orlando afb was transferred to the united states navy and became naval training center orlando in addition to boot camp facilities ntc orlando was home of one of two navy nuclear power schools and home of the naval air warfare center training systems division when mccoy afb closed in 1975 its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become orlando international airport while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the navy as mccoy ntc annex that closed in 1996 and became housing though the former mccoy afb still hosts a navy exchange as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service ntc orlando was closed in 1993 by the base realignment and closure commission and converted into the baldwin park neighborhood the air warfare center had moved to central florida regional park near ucf in 1988 tourism in history perhaps the most critical event for orlando 's economy occurred in 1965 when walt disney announced plans to build walt disney world although disney had considered the regions of miami and tampa for his park one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes orlando 's inland location although not free from hurricane damage exposed it to less threat than coastal regions the vacation resort opened in october 1971 ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the orlando metropolitan area which now encompasses orange seminole osceola and lake counties as a result tourism became the centerpiece of the area 's economy orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world another major factor in orlando 's growth occurred in 1962 when the new orlando jetport the precursor of the present day orlando international airport was built from a portion of the mccoy air force base by 1970 four major airlines delta air lines national airlines eastern airlines and southern airways were providing scheduled flights mccoy air force base officially closed in 1975 and most of it is now part of the airport the airport still retains the former air force base airport code mco 21st century today the historic core of old orlando resides in downtown orlando along church street between orange avenue and garland avenue urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history the present day historic district is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around lake eola where century old oaks line brick streets these neighborhoods known as lake eola heights and thornton park contain some of the oldest homes in orlando 2016 mass shooting on june 12 2016 more than 100 people were shot at pulse a gay nightclub in orlando at least 50 including the gunman were killed and 53 wounded the gunman whom the police swat team shot to death was identified as 29 year old omar mir seddique mateen an american security guard of afghan descent the incident widely denounced as an act of terrorism and a hate crime was both the deadliest mass shooting in modern united states history and one of the deadliest mass shootings perpetrated by a single person in recorded world history geography and cityscape the geography of orlando is mostly wetlands consisting of many lakes and swamps the terrain is generally flat making the land fairly low and wet the area is dotted with hundreds of lakes the largest of which is lake apopka central florida 's bedrock is mostly limestone and very porous the orlando area is susceptible to sinkholes probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in winter park a city immediately north of downtown orlando dubbed the winter park sinkhole there are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many unincorporated communities orlando 's city limits resemble a checkerboard with pockets of unincorporated orange county surrounded by city limits such an arrangement can be cumbersome as some areas are served by both orange county and the city of orlando this also explains orlando 's relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population the city and county are working together in an effort to round out the city limits with orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits skyscrapers metro orlando has a total of 19 completed skyscrapers the majority are located in downtown orlando and the rest are located in the tourist district southwest of downtown skyscrapers built in downtown orlando have not exceeded 441 ft 134 m since 1988 when suntrust center was completed downtown orlando the suntrust

hyatt regency orlando expansion tower winter 2010 428 ft 130 m is the tallest tower in orange county outside orlando 's city limits the orlando eye 400 ft 122 m was opened in 2015 climate orlando has a humid subtropical climate k ppen climate classification cfa like much of central florida orlando is located in usda plant hardiness zones 9b bordering 10a depending upon the year due to the urban heat island effect resulting from the immense urban growth and gulf stream there are two basic seasons in orlando a hot and rainy season lasting from may until late september roughly coinciding with the atlantic hurricane season and a warm and dry season from october through april the area 's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation its position relatively close to the tropic of cancer and its location in the center of a peninsula many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the gulf stream which flows around the peninsula of florida and the urban heat island effects which have become more prominent in the past couple decades allowing urban orlando to maintain usda 10a climactic similarities reflected in the frequent tropical foliage found in the region during the height of orlando 's humid summer season high temperatures are typically in the lower to mid 90s f 32 36 c while low temperatures rarely fall below 70 f 21 c the average window for such temperatures is april 19 october 11 the area 's humidity acts as a buffer usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding 100 f 38 c but also pushing the heat index to over 110 f 43 c the city 's highest recorded temperature is 103 f 39 c set on september 8 1921 during these months strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily these storms are caused by air masses from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean colliding over central florida they are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain sometimes several inches per hour and powerful winds as well as occasional damaging hail during the cooler season humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate and can fluctuate more readily the monthly daily average temperature in january is 60 2 f 15 7 c temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 2 4 nights per annum and the lowest recorded temperature is 18 f 8 c set on december 28 1894 because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts and their accompanying precipitation have passed snow is exceptionally rare the only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since recordkeeping began was in 1948 although there was some accumulation in surrounding areas in a snow event in january 1977 flurries have also been observed in 1989 and 2006 and 2010 the average annual rainfall in orlando is 50 6 inches 1290 mm a majority of which occurs in the period from june to september the months of october through may are orlando 's dry season during this period especially in its later months there is often a wildfire hazard during some years fires have been severe in 1998 a strong el ni o caused an unusually wet january and february followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in orlando and severely impacted normal daily life including the postponement of that year 's pepsi 400 nascar race in nearby daytona beach orlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk although it is not as high as in south florida 's urban corridor or other coastal regions since the city is located 42 miles 68 km inland from the atlantic and 77 miles 124 km inland from the gulf of mexico hurricanes usually weaken before arriving storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 feet 30 m above sea level despite its location the city does see strong hurricanes during the notorious 2004 hurricane season orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage with hurricane charley the worst of these the city also experienced widespread damage during hurricane donna in 1960 tornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the summer they are more common during the infrequent cold fronts of winter as well as in passing hurricanes the two worst major outbreaks in the area 's history a 1998 outbreak that killed 42 people and a 2007 outbreak that killed 21 both happened in february demographics as of 2010 there were 121254 households out of which 15 4 were vacant as of 2000 24 5 of households had

bourgeois apartments were so large that numerous families were assigned to what were called communal apartments kommunalkas by the 1930s 68 of the population lived in such housing in 1935 a new general plan was outlined whereby the city should expand to the south constructivism was rejected in favor of a more pompous stalinist architecture moving the city center further from the border with finland stalin adopted a plan to build a new city hall with a huge adjacent square at the southern end of moskovsky prospekt designated as the new main street of leningrad after the second world war the soviet finnish border moved northwards nevsky prospekt with palace square maintained the functions and the role of a city center in december 1931 leningrad was administratively separated from

pretext for the great purge during world war ii german forces besieged leningrad following the axis invasion of the soviet union in june 1941 the siege lasted 872 days from september 1941 to january 1944 the siege of leningrad proved one of the longest most destructive and most lethal sieges of a major city in modern history it isolated the city from most supplies except those provided through the road of life across lake ladoga more than one million civilians died mainly from starvation many others were eventually evacuated or escaped so the city became largely depopulated on may 1 1945

territories along the northern coast of the gulf of finland which had passed to the ussr from finland in 1940 under the peace treaty following the winter war were transferred from leningrad oblast to leningrad and divided into sestroretsky district and kurortny district these included the town of terijoki renamed zelenogorsk in 1948 leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the post war decades partially according to pre war plans the 1948 general plan for leningrad featured radial urban development in the north as well as in the south in 1953 pavlovsky district in leningrad oblast was abolished and parts of its territory including pavlovsk merged with leningrad in 1954 the settlements levashovo pargolovo and pesochny merged with leningrad leningrad gave its name to the leningrad affair 1949 1952 a notable event in the postwar political struggle in the ussr it was a product of rivalry between stalin 's potential successors where one side was represented by the leaders of the city communist party organization the second most significant one in the country after moscow the entire elite leadership of leningrad was destroyed including the former mayor kuznetsov the acting mayor pyotr sergeevich popkov and all their deputies overall 23 leaders were sentenced to the death penalty 181 to prison or exile exonerated in 1954 about 2000 ranking officials across the ussr were expelled from the party and the komsomol and removed from leadership positions the leningrad metro underground rapid transit system designed before the war opened in 1955 with its first eight stations decorated with marble and bronze however after the death of stalin in 1953 the perceived ornamental excesses of the stalinist architecture were abandoned from the 1960s to the 1980s many new residential boroughs were built on the outskirts while the functionalist apartment blocks were nearly identical to each other many families moved there from kommunalkas in the city centre in order to live in separate apartments on june 12 1991 simultaneously with the first russian presidential elections the city authorities arranged for the mayoral elections and a referendum upon the name of the city the turnout was 65 66 13 of the total count of votes went to anatoly sobchak who became the first directly elected mayor of the city meanwhile economic conditions started to deteriorate as the country tried to adapt to major changes for the first time since the 1940s food rationing was introduced and the city received humanitarian food aid from abroad this dramatic time was depicted in photographic series of russian photographer alexey titarenko in 1995 a northern section of the kirovsko vyborgskaya line of the saint petersburg metro was cut off by underground flooding creating a major obstacle to the city development for almost ten years in 1996 vladimir yakovlev defeated anatoly sobchak in the elections for the head of the city administration the title of the city head was changed from mayor to governor in 2000 yakovlev won re election his second term expired in 2004 the long awaited restoration of broken subway connection was expected to finish by that time but in 2003 yakovlev suddenly resigned leaving the governor 's office to valentina matviyenko the law on election of the city governor was changed breaking the tradition of democratic election by a universal suffrage in 2006 the city legislature re approved matviyenko as governor residential building had intensified again real estate prices inflated greatly which caused many new problems for the preservation of the historical part of the city although the central part of the city has a unesco designation there are about 8000 architectural monuments in petersburg the preservation of its historical and architectural environment became controversial after 2005 the demolition of older buildings in the historical centre was permitted in 2006 gazprom announced an ambitious project to erect a 396 meter skyscraper opposite to smolny which could result in the loss of the unique line of petersburg landscape urgent protests by citizens and prominent public figures of russia against this project were not considered by governor valentina matviyenko and the city authorities until december 2010 when after the statement of president dmitry medvedev the city decided to find a more appropriate location for this project geography the area of saint petersburg city proper is 605 8 square kilometers 233 9 sq mi the area of the federal subject is 1439 square kilometers 556 sq mi

saint petersburg ranges from the sea level to its highest point of 175 9 meters 577 ft at the orekhovaya hill in the duderhof heights in the south part of the city 's territory west of liteyny prospekt is no higher than 4 meters 13 ft above sea level and has suffered from numerous floods floods in saint petersburg are triggered by a long wave in the baltic sea caused by meteorological conditions winds and shallowness of the neva bay the four most disastrous floods occurred in 1824 421 centimeters or 166 inches above sea level during which over three hundred buildings were destroyed 1924 380 centimeters or 150 inches 1777 321 centimeters or 126 inches 1955 293 centimeters or 115 inches and 1975 281 centimeters or 111 inches to prevent floods the saint petersburg dam has been constructed since the 18th century the terrain in the city has been raised artificially at some places by more than 4 meters 13 ft making mergers of several islands and changing the hydrology of the city besides the neva and its tributaries other important rivers of the federal subject of saint petersburg are sestra okhta and izhora the largest lake is sestroretsky razliv in the north followed by lakhtinsky razliv suzdal lakes and other smaller lakes due to location at ca 60 n latitude the day length in petersburg varies across seasons ranging from 5 hours 53 minutes to 18 hours 50 minutes a period from mid may to mid july when twilight may last all night is called the white nights climate under the k ppen climate classification saint petersburg is classified as dfb a humid continental climate distinct moderating influence of the baltic sea cyclones result in warm humid and short summers and long moderately cold wet winters climate of saint petersburg is close to the climate of helsinki although colder in winter and warmer in summer because of its more eastern location the average maximum temperature in july is 23 c 73 f and the average minimum temperature in february is 8 5

due to gulf of finland the city also has a slightly warmer climate than its suburbs weather conditions are quite variable all year round toponymy the first and fairly rich chapter of the history of the local toponymy is the story of the own name of the city itself the name day of peter i falls on june 29 when the russian orthodox church observes the memory of saint apostles peter and paul the consecration of the small wooden church in their names its construction began simultaneously with the citadel made them the heavenly patrons of the peter and paul fortress while st peter at the same time became the eponym of the whole city an explanation that the origin of saint in saint petersburg is due to peter the great 's contact with dutch culture is a common misconception however this is unlikely as the dutch republic adhered to calvinist protestantism and had long abandoned and even frowned upon the culture of veneration of saints and the naming of places after them since the era of reformation moreover saint in the dutch language is sint and not sankt the sample which czar peter followed does sound like the names of another european cities sankt goar in germany sankt michael in austria and some others of which the closest to sankt petersburg was sankt michel in the rival swedish empire now mikkeli in finland sankt in these toponyms is merely a germanized form of latin sanctus a 14 to 15 letter long name composed of the three roots proved too cumbersome and a lot of shortened versions appeared in habitual use the first general governor of the city menshikov is maybe also the author of the first nickname of petersburg which he called petri it took some years until the known russian spelling of this name finally settled in 1740s mikhail lomonosov uses a derivative of greek petropolis in a russified form petropol' a combo piterpol also appears at this time in any case eventually the usage of prefix sankt ceased except for the formal official documents where a 3 letter abbreviation spb was very widely used as well in the 1830s alexander pushkin translated the foreign city name of saint petersburg to the more russian petrograd in one of his poems however it was only on 31 o s 18 august 1914 after the war with germany had begun that tsar nicholas ii renamed the capital to petrograd since the prefix 'saint' was omitted this act also changed the eponym and the patron of the city from apostle peter to peter the great its founder after the october revolution the name red petrograd was often used in newspapers and other prints until the city was renamed leningrad in january 1924 a referendum on reversing the renaming of leningrad was held on june 12 1991 with 54 86 of voters with a turnout of 65 supporting saint petersburg renaming the city petrograd was not an option this change officially took effect on september 6 1991 meanwhile the oblast whose administrative center is also in saint petersburg is still named leningrad having passed the role of capital to petersburg moscow never relinquished the title of capital being called pervoprestolnaya first throned for 200 years an equivalent name for petersburg the northern capital has re entered usage today since several federal institutions were recently moved from moscow to saint petersburg solemn descriptive names like the city of three revolutions and the cradle of the october revolution used in soviet era are reminders of the pivotal events in national history which occurred here for their part poetic names of the city like the venice of the north and the northern palmyra emphasize town planning and architectural features contrasting these parallels to the northern location of this megalopolis petropolis is a translation of a city name to greek and is also a kind of descriptive name is a greek root for stone so the city from stone emphasizes the material which had been forcibly made obligatory for construction from the very first years of the city its official greek name is

local government districts breckland district broadland district great yarmouth borough king 's lynn and west norfolk borough north norfolk district norwich city and south norfolk district as of 2014 the conservatives controlled five of the seven districts while norwich is controlled by labour and great yarmouth is under no overall control the county is traditionally a stronghold for the conservatives who have always won at least 50 of norfolk 's parliamentary constituencies since 1979 the countryside is mostly solid conservative territory with a few areas being strong for the liberal democrats from 1995 to 2007 south norfolk was run by the liberal democrats but the district switched back to the conservatives in a landslide in 2007 norfolk 's urban areas are more mixed although norwich and central parts of great yarmouth and king 's lynn are strong for the labour party this said labour 's dominance in norwich has recently been stemmed by the green party who are now the official opposition on norwich city council and also hold several divisions within the city on norfolk county council norfolk county council had been under conservative control since 1997 but they lost overall control at the 2013 election when the conservatives lost 20 seats and ukip gained 14 as at 2013 there are 40 conservative councillors 15 ukip 14 labour 10 liberal democrats 4 green party and one independent although the conservatives had been expected to form a minority administration or to seek a coalition with the liberal democrats both scenarios failed to materialise eventually a rainbow alliance between labour the liberal democrats greens and ukip was formed with the cabinet composed solely of labour and liberal democrats norwich unitary authority dispute in october 2006 the department for communities and local government produced a local government white paper inviting councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring in january 2007 norwich submitted its proposal which was rejected in december 2007 as it did not meet the criteria for acceptance in february 2008 the boundary committee for england from 1 april 2010 incorporated in the local government boundary commission for england was asked to consider alternative proposals for the whole or part of norfolk including whether norwich should become a unitary authority separate from norfolk county council in december 2009 the boundary committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of norfolk including norwich however on 10 february 2010 it was announced that contrary to the december 2009 recommendation of the boundary committee norwich would be given separate unitary status the proposed change was strongly resisted principally by norfolk county council and the conservative opposition in parliament reacting to the announcement norfolk county council issued a statement that it would seek leave to challenge the decision in the courts a letter was leaked to the local media in which the permanent secretary for the department for communities and local government noted that the decision did not meet all the criteria and that the risk of it being successfully challenged in judicial review proceedings is very high the shadow local government and planning minister bob neill stated that should the conservative party win the 2010 general election they would reverse the decision following the 2010 general election eric pickles was appointed secretary of state for communities and local government on 12 may 2010 in a conservative liberal democrat coalition government according to press reports he instructed his department to take urgent steps to reverse the decision and maintain the status quo in line with the conservative party manifesto however the unitary plans were supported by the liberal democrat group on the city council and by simon wright libdem mp for norwich south who intended to lobby the party leadership to allow the changes to go ahead the local government act 2010 to reverse the unitary decision for norwich and exeter and suffolk received royal assent on 16 december 2010 the disputed award of unitary status had meanwhile been referred to the high court and on 21 june 2010 the court mr justice ouseley judge ruled it unlawful and revoked it the city has therefore failed to attain permanent unitary status and the previous two tier arrangement of county and district councils with norwich city council counted among the latter remains the status quo westminster following the may 2015 general election norfolk is represented in the house of commons by seven conservative members of parliament one labour member of parliament and one liberal democrat 1 green lca independents others 2 ukip lca independents others settlements norfolk

phrases have died out due to a number of factors such as radio tv and people from other parts of the country coming to norfolk as a result the speech of norfolk is more of an accent than a dialect

prehistoric martis people in the reno area as early as the mid 1850s a few pioneers settled in the truckee meadows a relatively fertile valley through which the truckee river made its way from lake tahoe to pyramid lake in addition to subsistence farming these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the california trail which followed the truckee westward before branching off towards donner lake where the formidable obstacle of the sierra nevada began gold was discovered in the vicinity of virginia city in 1850 and a modest mining community developed but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the comstock lode led to a mining rush to provide the necessary connection between virginia city and the california trail charles w fuller built a log toll bridge across the truckee river in 1859 a small community that would service travelers soon grew up near the bridge after two years fuller sold the bridge to myron c lake who continued to develop the community with the addition of a grist mill kiln and livery stable to the hotel and eating house he renamed it lake 's crossing in 1864 washoe county was consolidated with roop county and lake 's crossing became the largest town in the county lake had earned himself the title founder of reno by january 1863 the central pacific railroad cprr had begun laying tracks east from sacramento california eventually connecting with the union pacific railroad at promontory utah to form the first transcontinental railroad lake deeded land to the cprr in exchange for its promise to build a depot at lake 's crossing

reno a union officer killed in the american civil war at the battle of south mountain in 1871 reno became the county seat of the newly expanded washoe county replacing the previous county seat located in washoe city however political power in nevada remained with the mining communities first virginia city and later tonopah and goldfield the extension of the virginia and truckee railroad to reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city 's economy in the following decades reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between sacramento and salt lake city as the mining boom waned early in the 20th century nevada 's centers of political and business activity shifted to the non mining communities especially reno and las vegas and today the former mining metropolises stand as little more than ghost towns despite this nevada is still the third largest gold producer in the world after south africa and australia the state yielded 6 9 percent of the world 's supply in 2005 world gold production the reno arch was erected on virginia street in 1926 to promote the upcoming transcontinental highways exposition of 1927 the arch included the words nevada 's transcontinental highways exposition and the dates of the exposition after the exposition the reno city council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway and mayor e e roberts asked the citizens of reno to suggest a slogan for the arch no acceptable slogan was received until a 100 prize was offered and g a burns of sacramento was declared the winner on march 14 1929 with reno the biggest little city in the world reno took a leap when the state of nevada legalized open gambling on march 19 1931 along with the passage of even more liberal divorce laws than places like hot springs arkansas offered no other state offered what nevada did in the 1930s and casinos like the bank club and palace were popular within a few years the bank club owned by george wingfield bill graham and jim mckay was the state 's largest employer and the largest casino in the world wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits along with his rent ernie pyle once wrote in one of his columns all the people you saw on the streets in reno were obviously there to get divorces in ayn rand 's novel the fountainhead published in 1943 the new york based female protagonist tells a friend i am going to reno which is taken as a different way of saying i am going to divorce my husband among others the belgian french writer georges simenon at the time living in the u s came to reno in 1950 in order to divorce his first wife the divorce business eventually died as the other states fell in line by passing their own laws easing the requirements for divorce but gambling continued as a major reno industry while gaming pioneers like pappy and harold smith of harold 's club and bill harrah of the soon to dominate harrah 's casino set up shop in the 1930s the war years of the 1940s cemented reno as the place to play for two decades beginning in the 1950s the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation a disaster occurred on the afternoon of february 5 1957 when an explosion ripped through the heart of downtown at 1 03 pm two explosions caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city and an ensuing fire destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of sierra and first streets along the truckee river forty nine people were injured in the disaster and two were killed the first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of sierra street now the site of the century riverside the second across sierra street now the site of the palladio the presence of a main east west rail line the emerging interstate highway system favorable state tax climate and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods in the 1980s indian gaming rules were relaxed and starting in 2000 californian native casinos began to cut into casino revenues major new construction projects have been completed in the reno and sparks areas a few new luxury communities were recently built in truckee california approximately 28 miles 45 km west of reno on interstate 80 reno also is an outdoor recreation destination due to its close proximity to the sierra nevada lake tahoe and numerous ski resorts in the region in more recent years the city has gained some notoriety as the subject of the comedy series reno 911 the main scenes of which however are filmed in the city of carson california on may 9 2014 the reno historical app was released in conjunction with the city 's celebration of its 111th birthday as an incorporated city the free app puts reno 's history at users' fingertips

area they act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it wetlands are home to over 75 of the species in the great basin however the area 's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city while developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals washoe county has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems mitigation in the future when developers try to build over a wetland they will be responsible for creating another wetland near washoe lake the truckee river serves as reno 's primary source of drinking water it supplies reno with 80 million u s gallons 300 ml of water a day during the summer and 40 million u s gallons 150 ml of water per day in the winter before the water goes to the homes around the reno area it must go to one of two water treatment plants chalk bluff or glendale water treatment plant as an attempt to save water golf courses in reno have been using treated effluent water instead of treated water from one of reno 's water plants the reno sparks wastewater treatment plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the truckee river in the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30 million u s gallons 70 to 110 million liters per day while treated the effluent contains suspended solids nitrogen and phosphorus aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of pyramid lake local agencies working with the environmental protection agency have developed a number of watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded effluent discharge to accomplish this successful outcome the dssam model was developed and calibrated for the truckee river in order to analyze the most cost effective available management strategy set the resulting management strategies included a package of measures such as land use controls in the lake tahoe basin urban runoff controls in reno and sparks and best management practices for wastewater discharge the reno area is frequently subject to wildfires causing property damage and sometimes loss of life in august 1960 the donner ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days in november 2011 arcing from powerlines caused a fire in caughlin in southwest reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one older man and only two months later in january 2012 another fire in washoe drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one older woman around 10000 residents were evacuated and a state of emergency was declared the fires came at the end of reno 's longest recorded dry spell geology reno is situated just east of the sierra nevada on the western edge of the great basin at an elevation of about 4400 feet 1300 m above sea level numerous faults exist throughout the region most of these are normal vertical motion faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges including the sierra nevada in february 2008 an earthquake swarm began to occur lasting for several months and with the largest quake registering at 4 9 on the richter magnitude scale although some geologic estimates put it at 5 0 the earthquakes were centered on the somersett community in western reno near the areas of mogul and verdi many homes in these areas were damaged climate reno sits in the rain shadow of the sierra nevada mountain range annual rainfall averages 7 48 inches 190 mm despite this low amount of rainfall per year reno features a steppe climate k ppen bsk due to its low evapotranspiration annual precipitation has ranged from 1 55 inches 39 4 mm in 1947 to 13 23 inches 336 0 mm in 1983 the most precipitation in one month was 5 25 inches 133 4 mm in december 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was 2 29 inches 58 2 mm on january 21 1943 winter has snowfall which is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days averaging 21 5 inches 55 cm annually snowfall varies with the lowest amounts roughly 19 23 inches annually at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the reno tahoe international airport at 4404 feet 1342 m while the foothills of the carson range to the west ranging from 4700 to 5600 feet 1400 to 1700 m in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive up to two to three times as much annual snowfall the mountains of the virginia range to the east can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation and around twice as much annual snowfall above 5500 feet 1700 m however snowfall increases in the virginia range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the carson range to the west because the virginia range is well within the rain shadow of the sierra nevada and carson range the most snowfall in the city in one year was 63 8 inches 162 cm in 1971 and the most snowfall in one month was 29 0 inches 74 cm in march 1952 most rainfall occurs in winter and spring the city has 300 days of sunshine per year summer thunderstorms can occur between april and october the eastern side of town and the mountains east of reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind called a washoe zephyr can develop in the sierra nevada causing air to be pulled down in the sierra nevada and reno destroying or preventing thunderstorms but the same wind can push air upwards against the virginia range and other mountain ranges east of reno creating powerful thunderstorms the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 35 3 f 1 8 c in december to 74 9 f 23 8 c in july with the diurnal temperature variation reaching 35 f 19 c in summer still lower than much of the high desert to the east there are 3 9 days of 100 f 38 c highs 58 days of 90 f 32 c highs and 2 5 nights with sub 10 f 12 c lows annually the temperature does not rise above freezing on

bromwicham there is a distinctive brummie accent and dialect history pre history and medieval birmingham 's early history is that of a remote and marginal area the main centres of population power and wealth in the pre industrial english midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the trent the severn and the avon the area of modern birmingham lay in between on the upland birmingham plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated forest of arden there is evidence of early human activity in the birmingham area dating back 10000 years with stone age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling the many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the bronze age when a substantial but short lived influx of population occurred between 1700 bc and 1000 bc possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area during the 1st century roman conquest of britain the forested country of the birmingham plateau formed a barrier to the advancing roman legions who built the large metchley fort in the area of modern day edgbaston in ad 48 and made it the focus of a network of roman roads birmingham as a settlement dates from the anglo saxon era the city 's name comes from the old english beormingah m meaning the home or settlement of the beormingas indicating that birmingham was established in the 6th or early 7th century as the primary settlement of an anglian tribal grouping and regio of that name despite this early importance by the time of the domesday book of 1086 the manor of birmingham was one of the poorest and least populated in warwickshire valued at only 20 shillings with the area of the modern city divided between the counties of warwickshire staffordshire and worcestershire the development of birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166 when the lord of the manor peter de bermingham obtained a charter to hold a market at his castle and followed this with the creation of a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate around the site that became the bull ring this established birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the birmingham plateau at a time when the area 's economy was expanding rapidly with population growth nationally leading to the clearance cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land within a century of the charter birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen by 1327 it was the third largest town in warwickshire a position it would retain for the next 200 years early modern the principal governing institutions of medieval birmingham including the guild of the holy cross and the lordship of the de birmingham family collapsed between 1536 and 1547 leaving the town with an unusually high degree of social and economic freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth by 1700 birmingham 's population had increased fifteenfold and the town was the fifth largest in england and wales the importance of the manufacture of iron goods to birmingham 's economy was recognised as early as 1538 and grew rapidly as the century progressed equally significant was the town 's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry 's products by the 1600s birmingham formed the commercial hub of a network of forges and furnaces stretching from south wales to cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the west indies these trading links gave birmingham 's metalworkers access to much wider markets allowing them to diversify away from lower skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale towards a broader range of specialist higher skilled and more lucrative activities by the time of the english civil war birmingham 's booming economy its expanding population and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak the town 's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by royalist forces in the battle of birmingham in 1643 and it developed into a centre of puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for nonconformists from the 1660s the 18th century saw this tradition of free thinking and collaboration blossom into the cultural phenomenon now known as the midlands enlightenment the town developed into a notable centre of literary musical artistic and theatrical activity and its leading citizens particularly the members of the lunar society of birmingham became influential participants in the circulation of philosophical and scientific ideas among europe 's intellectual elite the close relationship between enlightenment birmingham 's leading thinkers and its major manufacturers in men like matthew boulton and james keir they were often in fact the same people made it particularly important for the exchange of knowledge between pure science and the practical world of manufacturing and technology this created a chain reaction of innovation forming a pivotal link between the earlier scientific revolution and the industrial revolution that would follow industrial revolution birmingham 's explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the textile manufacturing towns of the north of england and was driven by different factors instead of the economies of scale of a low paid unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large mechanised units of production birmingham 's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small often self owned workshops this led to exceptional levels of inventiveness between 1760 and 1850 the core years of the industrial revolution birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other british town or city the demand for capital to feed rapid economic expansion also saw birmingham grow into a major financial centre with extensive international connections lloyds bank was founded in the town in 1765 and ketley 's building society the world 's first building society in 1775 by 1800 the west midlands had more banking offices per head than any other region in britain including london innovation in 18th century birmingham often took the form of incremental series of small scale improvements to existing products or processes but also included major developments that lay at the heart of the emergence of industrial society in 1709 the birmingham trained abraham darby i moved to coalbrookdale in shropshire and built the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron ore with coke transforming the quality volume and scale on which it was possible to produce cast iron in 1732 lewis paul and john wyatt invented roller spinning the one novel idea of the first importance in the development of the mechanised cotton industry in 1741 they opened the world 's first cotton mill in birmingham 's upper priory in 1746 john roebuck invented the lead chamber process enabling the large scale manufacture of sulphuric acid and in 1780 james keir developed a process for the bulk manufacture of alkali together marking the birth of the modern chemical industry in 1765 matthew boulton opened the soho manufactory pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate manufacturing activities through a system known as rational manufacture as the largest manufacturing unit in europe this come to symbolise the emergence of the factory system most significant however was the development in 1776 of the industrial steam engine by james watt and matthew boulton freeing for the first time the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand water and animal power this was arguably the pivotal moment of the entire industrial revolution and a key factor in the worldwide increases in productivity that would follow over the following century regency and victorian birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early 19th century with thomas attwood and the birmingham political union bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the days of may that preceded the passing of the great reform act in 1832 the union 's meetings on newhall hill in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies britain had ever seen lord durham who drafted the act wrote that the country owed reform to birmingham and its salvation from revolution this reputation for having shaken the fabric of privilege to its base in 1832 led john bright to make birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the second reform act of 1867 which extended voting rights to the urban working class birmingham 's tradition of innovation continued into the 19th century birmingham was the terminus for both of the world 's first two long distance railway lines the 82 mile grand junction railway of 1837 and the 112 mile london and birmingham railway of 1838 birmingham schoolteacher rowland hill invented the postage stamp and created the first modern universal postal system in 1839 alexander parkes invented the first man made plastic in the jewellery quarter in 1855 by the 1820s an extensive canal system had been constructed giving greater access to natural resources and fuel for industries during the victorian era the population of birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and birmingham became the second largest population centre in england birmingham was granted city status in 1889 by queen victoria joseph chamberlain mayor of birmingham and

established its own university in 1900 20th century and contemporary birmingham suffered heavy bomb damage during world war ii 's birmingham blitz the city was also the scene of two scientific discoveries that were to prove critical to the outcome of the war otto frisch and rudolf peierls first described how a practical nuclear weapon could be constructed in the frisch peierls memorandum of 1940 the same year that the cavity magnetron the key component of radar and later of microwave ovens was invented by john randall and henry boot details of these two discoveries together with an outline of the first jet engine invented by frank whittle in nearby rugby were taken to the united states by the tizard mission in september 1940 in a single black box later described by an official american historian as the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores the city was extensively redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s this included the construction of large tower block estates such as castle vale the bull ring was reconstructed and new street station was redeveloped in the decades following world war ii the ethnic makeup of birmingham changed significantly as it received waves of immigration from the commonwealth of nations and beyond the city 's population peaked in 1951 at 1113000 residents birmingham remained by far britain 's most prosperous provincial city as late as the 1970s with household incomes exceeding even those of london and the south east but its economic diversity and capacity for regeneration declined in the decades that followed world war ii as central government sought to restrict the city 's growth and disperse industry and population to the stagnating areas of scotland wales and northern england these measures hindered the natural self regeneration of businesses in birmingham leaving it top heavy with the old and infirm and the city became increasingly dependent on the motor industry the recession of the early 1980s saw birmingham 's economy collapse with unprecedented levels of unemployment and outbreaks of social unrest in inner city districts in recent years many parts of birmingham have been transformed with the redevelopment of the bullring shopping centre and regeneration of old industrial areas such as brindleyplace the mailbox and the international convention centre old streets buildings and canals have been restored the pedestrian subways have been removed and the inner ring road has been rationalised in 1998 birmingham hosted the 24th g8 summit government birmingham city council is the largest
